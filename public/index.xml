      <description>Camper graphic by Vecteezy!
I grew up in central New Jersey. My family lived a modest middle class lifestyle and I’d never flown on a plane with my nuclear family growing up. What we did was camp. We went car camping every summer. I have fond memories up through 8th grade of those summers.
When I was in the 5th grade and about 10 years old, we went on a month long car camping trip from New Jersey to California through the middle states (Illinois, North Dakota, Colorado), and then back through the southern states (Arizona, Texas, Louisiana).</description>

      <title>Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing</title>

      <description>About Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing (URUT) is a technique for conducting usability testing where participants take test sessions alone and without the presence or interaction with a facilitator. Sessions are usually conducted with the aid of a remote testing software service.
While moderated testing is preferred, URUT may be beneficial when budget or time constraints are an issue. Because URUT is conducted asynchronously, there are some disadvantages. For instance, when instructed, users may not employ the think aloud approach on their own without prompting, users cannot seek support including asking for clarification if tasks are not clear, and facilitators cannot ask follow up questions.</description>

      <title>The Power of 100</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/power-of-100/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/power-of-100/</guid>
      <description>Josh Spector’s article, “Only Do It If You’re Willing To Do It 100 Times,” explains why committing to doing something 100 times furthers your efforts towards accomplishing a goal. He writes that the 100x method gives you a way to use a seemingly arbitrary structure to discipline you through the challenge of working towards a goal that may seem large at the onset. That structure also serves to push you forward through what Seth Godin refers to in&amp;nbsp;The Dip&amp;nbsp;— that point in the project where you’re unsure whether to go on or quit.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/1-1-1-1-dns-service/</guid>
      <description>1.1.1.1 is a DNS service created by Cloudflare and APNIC to offer you a more private experience on the Internet. Here’s what they say:
Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.</description>

      <description>feColorMatrix is an SVG filter that changes colors based on a transformation matrix. Every pixel’s color value (represented by an [R,G,B,A] vector) is matrix multiplied to create a new color.
This filter allows granular per channel color manipulation. Una Kravets wrote an excellent article explaining how to use it.</description>

      <description>This is a little zine I made from my Sketch talk.
I&amp;rsquo;m putting these in the package when people buy a sketchbook. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sending one out soon to everyone who already purchased a book. Still working on setting up international shipping. :)

A little zine has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to make. This is a zine in the traditional, DIY photocopy sense. It&amp;rsquo;s not an art piece, as so many beautiful zines are these days.</description>

      <description>In my Skillshare course there&amp;rsquo;s a brief moment where I show a ratio calculator that I use for doing things like figuring out dimensions of containers while designing.
The idea is simple. You have a ratio like 16:9, 4:3, 9:6, etc. and want to see how to scale another object with that ratio using a fixed dimension, e.g. you know the width.
Here are a few that I like:

      <description>I published a free course for Balsamiq users on Skillshare. The course, Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design, is designed for those new to Balsamiq, but also features some demonstration of new features like Quick Draw (using the mouse to block out wireframe zones) and Alternates (creating alternate versions of screens). If you&amp;rsquo;re a veteran user, you may be interested in checking that out, and updating to the latest version to take advantage of these useful new ways of working on projects.</description>

      <description>Remember these? From 2009-2010 I these sketchbooks for a while, using a 5.25&amp;rdquo; floppy disk as a notebook cover. I kind of missed them, so I made a limited number in blank and grid paper.
It’s a wirebound 5.25 inch square sketchbook with about 120-130 pages (60-65 sheets) of 70 pound white vellum paper, hand-crafted by me in my home North of the SF Bay. You can buy a book with blank sheets or one printed with 1cm grid in warm gray ink.</description>

      <description>Principle for Mac ($99) is a tool for designing animation, primarily for mobile devices. It provides an easy to use interface for prototyping interaction, transitions, or other animated elements in your interface.
You can design with text, rectangles (which can modified with border radius to make circles), or graphics created with other tools, and then hook up animations for actions like taps, scrolling, and drag, and use the drivers UI to connect those actions to drive other properties.</description>

      <description>For Balsamiq users or anyone that bemoans handwritten fonts and sketchy wireframes, I wrote an article to show how to create polished wireframes in Balsamiq on our UX blog. It shows how to use the wireframe skin with a few base controls, and techniques to achieve a minimalist aesthetic. It&amp;rsquo;s meant for those who need to create client-ready deliverables, or for when the sketchy-skin gets in the way of communicating your ideas.</description>

      <title>Jim Kalbach on Jazz as a Model for the Way Businesses Work</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/jim-kalbach-jazz/</guid>
      <description>Jim Kalbach talks about the improvisational model of Jazz as a metaphor for the way some businesses approach collaboration today. What was probably seen a few years ago as a radical way of structuring companies to organize around the work rather than using inflexible business units as boundaries, is now more commonplace.
To demonstrate what happens in the teamwork of a group of jazz performers, Kalbach assembled a group of musicians to perform a song they hadn&amp;rsquo;t played together before, and described how jazz performances &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; as a type of collaboration.</description>

      <description>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I did it.
Choosing Static Site Generators In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</description>

Balkan talks about business models that focus on user data, and what that can mean to your &#34;privacy.&#34; Watch the talk below, given at Open Exchange in Munich, Germany.  The information you hand over using service providers like Facebook (think also Messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram) and Google (think also Gmail, Hangouts, Android Devices, Drive, Nest, Dropcam, and Fiber) is already being used to create simulations of you, and he likens this use to spyware.</description>

      <description>The devil runs UX workshops for idle hands, and he comes up with bad features. This is Des Traynor&amp;rsquo;s lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic.

      <title>AniJS: Declarative handling library for CSS animations</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/anijs-declarative-handling-library-css-animations/</guid>
      <description>AniJS is a library for CSS animations that allows you to write simple statements for handling animation as key/value pairs in html data attributes. It feels very close to writing natural language statements, in a format that is a bit more familiar in code than writing sentences. A simple example contains IF, ON, DO, and TO pairs and would look like this: &amp;lt;input id=&#34;name&#34; type=&#34;text&#34; data-anijs=&#34;if: focus, do: wobble, to: p&#34;</description>

      <description>uilang is a minimal, ui-focused programming language for web designers that handles click events, primarily for toggling classes and css display properties. I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on &#34;.try-it&#34; toggles class &#34;hidden&#34; on &#34;.info-box&#34;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that&#39;s a plus if you don&#39;t want or need someone else&#39;s implementation of those things.</description>

      <description>I got an IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard System ($149 retail price) to demo and did a first little experiment. The product consists of a video sensor and interactive pen. You have to have a projector as well. Here&#39;s a super rough demo I made for my team at Balsamiq to show how it would work using Balsamiq Mockups.
 While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it&#39;s pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you&#39;re so inclined.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/what-if-dj-controllers-had-built-screens/</guid>
      <description>This is a cool design challenge that showed up on DJ Tech Tools&amp;rsquo; blog to mock up DJ controllers. DJ gear vendor Numark is reported to be releasing a controller with a screen. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting, because it could potentially let digital DJs that use them close their computer screen and focus on performing.
While there are CDJs that already have color LCDs to preview deck track information, midi controllers are largely comprised of faders, buttons, knobs, toggle switches, jog wheels, and touch sensitive strips.</description>

      <description>A group of 99u attendees had a visit with Ben Kaufman, the CEO/founder of product development company Quirky, who gave us a look into how his company uses crowd-sourcing to deliver products. Here are some of my notes from that visit. More 99u notes to follow.
Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case.</description>

      <description>Cotton Bureau uses the off-canvas pattern to slide steps of the checkout flow into the screen from the right, as the product page and previous steps slide off screen to the left.
I like how this implies the forward movement through the checkout process a bit better than the cart workflows that use vertically arranged collapsing panels.
1. Product page.2. After adding product to cart, the cart panel slides in from right, and product panel slides off canvas to left.</description>

      <description>Beatport&#39;s Pro app for the Mac offers a shopping experience that&#39;s tailored for the way DJs shop for music. The app lets users analyze their music (tracks, sounds, and playlists) to prepare sets and add music to their playlists. Here are some of the elements of the version 2 interface related to shopping in the app.
Beatport comes close to the experience of shopping in a record store, breaking down music into genres and sub-genres.</description>

      <description>I love Berg&amp;rsquo;s demo of their Cloudwash smart washing machine concept. The company created the prototype to demonstrate how a smart networked appliance might be better designed. The video provides an excellent walkthrough of their design process.
They simplify the face, which consisted of many controls for dedicated functions, reducing that to &amp;ldquo;high value functions&amp;rdquo; only. More functionality is accessible via a smart phone app, which also integrates the device with services such as warranty and supplies management and purchasing.</description>

      <description>This is a cute interaction for the input focus and data validation on Basecamp&#39;s registration form. The smiling character illustration on the left points out which steps are in focus. When an invalid value is entered, the character makes a concerned face and the pointing hand stays fixed on the highlighted input.
The illustrations on the site do a great job of making you feel like this isn&#39;t &amp;quot;business as usual,&amp;quot; which is the reason for switching to Basecamp.</description>

1. A really strong password.2. A dictionary word is weak. 3. Better, but still weak. The messaging may be convincing enough to get users to think about their choice.

      <description>I like the simple idea behind GluePrint. Drop your mockup or visual design comp onto the app and it provides a semi-opaque window of the design. I can see it being useful for overlaying on top of your browser, like an onionskin, while you&amp;rsquo;re working on front end implementation. And even in other reverse scenarios, like for creating new designs based on an existing version of your product.

      <description>We know that starting with why is important to product design, but what comes next? &#34;How&#34; would definitely come soon after. But there are many ways to propose how to begin exploring possibilities. The 99u points to a number of questions to ask before starting a project, and how language matters. They refer to Warren Berger&#39;s article in the Harvard Business Review about one of the questions top innovators ask when confronted with a design challenge.</description>

      <description>YouTube puts up 2 speed bumps when you try to delete a video from the video manager. This technique slows down the user about to peform a destructive action, and protects them from inadvertently deleting content.
1. Selecting Delete action shows dialog confirming action.2. A second confirmation dialog requires confirmation, but the Delete button is disabled until the countdown timer runs out.

Art and Design Movie Quotes
I&#39;ve made it a habit to try and find documentaries about an art/craft to watch whenever I fly, so it made sense to take notes as I would in my journal and put them up here for inspiration. You&#39;ll find quotes from the following movies here:</description>

      <description>Remote Preview is a JavaScript-based tool for previewing a web page on multiple devices, built by Viljami Salminen @viljamis for the Helsinki Device Lab. Just enter a URL, hit Enter, and the new URL gets automatically loaded on each device. Works on platforms like Android, Blackberry, iOS, Maemo, Meego, Symbian, Windows Phone and WebOS. I don&#39;t think the GameBoy pictured is supported. ;)

      <description>After repeatedly using a pattern of term + description to describe something, I wondered if other people in my Twitter-sphere used the same or similar language to describe a common artifact. My question started:
I was wondering if people used different terms to describe either drawings made in software or on paper that describe a screen view at a high level of abstraction that uses only lines and labels.
 Accompanied by this screenshot: It&#39;s interesting to learn that we use so many terms to describe essentially the same thing, although some of the confusion in this discussion might be with understanding what I meant by my question:</description>

      <description>Fastco interviewed Chrissie Brodigan, design and UX researcher at GitHub to talk about how they&#39;re using deprivation to study people&#39;s reaction to removing elements from a product.
The gist of the technique is to work with a set of participants who develop a pattern of use around a feature or design characteristic and journal their experience. After some time, at a point when they&#39;ve had time to be accustomed to that thing, they take away or alter it, and observe through the journal what the users&#39; reactions are to its removal.</description>

      <description>I can&#39;t imagine email ever being the right way to critique design, or give feedback as a client, but nevertheless it happens, and Julius Tarng, who works on the Branch app, came up with some good advice for those about to give email, and those about to receive it. I think the advice applies for any feedback that&#39;s not face to face to face including chat and in comments.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t like public speaking. I love talking to people one to one and in very small groups. But public speaking and me don&#39;t mix, and if you&#39;ve ever seen me speak, you probably agree. In the handful of times that I have spoken publicly, I think only two were really worth coming to see and hear. I believe the only reason the worthwhile talks were not utter failures was because I had something to share that I think people wanted to hear, and could get something out of.</description>

      <description>I was looking for a way to add stories to Pivotal Tracker without having to load their UI in the web browser. I wanted something as fast as using Alfred, and found Jelle Vandebeeck&amp;rsquo;s Pivot App for the Mac.
Pivot puts an icon in your menubar, and drops down a form to file chores, features, bugs, and releases with auto-completion for projects, owners, and tags. Simple. Only thing I could want more from this is a clipboard link to the story, or an optional description field, but is otherwise near perfect.</description>

      <description>Google Web Designer is design and development tools for creating interactive HTML5-based motion graphics. The tool looks like it&amp;rsquo;s targeted at advertising creative. It provides templates for banner ads, which makes sense, but can be used for generating any canvas motion graphics. The default layouts are for DoubleClick and AdMob mobile ads.
Web Designer is a web application that&#39;s built with HTML5, and runs natively on your desktop. It provides support for text, images, videos, and even provides bezier drawing tools for creating shapes and 3d objects.</description>

      <description>Frontify looks like an interesting SaaS product for design teams. It provides collaborative features for getting design feedback, creating specifications, documentation and style guides, and linking pages together.
The commenting and linking features are what you&#39;d expect, but what I was really impressed with are the measures, colors, and typography tools for generating style guides. Very nicely done. There are additional capabilities for code export &amp;amp; integration with their API.</description>

      <description>Semantic UI is a framework for building HTML sites that aims at creating a system based on semantic naming and sensible defaults.
The framework compares itself directly with Bootstrap. It uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements. Interface definitions are tag ambivalent so you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element.

      <description>I started keeping a journal in 2011 about a personal project I had undertaken towards simplifying aspects of my life. The impetus came after downsizing homes, having children, and realizing that things I had accumulated began to require more space, maintenance, and attention than I was willing to give. Possessing things began to cost more than the enjoyment they provided in return.
I, with my taste for electronics, hand-crafted goods, and toys, have not always found it easy to let go of things.</description>

      <description>If you take a lot of screenshots on a Mac like me, you probably have a good workflow for doing it using something like LittleSnapper/Ember, Awesome Screenshot or Skitch. The biggest problem I&#39;ve had is that after I take a screenshot, I often want to do something with it. I can do this by just getting Cloud to watch and upload files passively, but I&#39;ve always wanted to save to my own server after just issuing one command to capture the page.</description>

      <description>Macaw is a forthcoming Mac application for designing pages for web browsers that are ready to use as web-native code. The app runs natively in html and css, and provides excellent export to clean html and css.
There are some great optimizations for nudging/pudging on a grid, and for setting properties that make sense for css—thinking of positioning and dimensions.
The outline view is a nice way to browse through all the groups in the document and adding container tags and/or classes for semantic html publishing.</description>

      <description>Jackson Fox and Jeremy Fields did an excellent 2-part write on the use of &#34;infield&#34; labels at Viget. There are several techniques for placing labels inside the input box. For varying reasons we may want to avoid the label on top or side positioning, but as Jackson points out, the infield placement can be problematic. Part 1 talks about the problems using infield labels. Part 2 shows how they deal with the problem by using a visible tooltip that doesn&#39;t obscure the input, with a jsFiddle snippet to play with the code.</description>

Sketchnote Text is a friendly, casual script with a bouncy baseline and a warm texture. To emulate natural hand­writing, OpenType features auto­matically switch be­tween multiple versions of each letter or number, with over 240 alter­nates in each text font.</description>

      <description>PowWow is a free simple service for scheduling user research using your Google Calendar. The fine folks at Pointless Corp (aka Viget) created this as a side project for handling scheduling of user interviews and testing, but could be used for any kind of event.
There are other apps like this that remove the fuss of coordinating schedules via email. PowWow does it simply, and provides a polished and pleasing experience.</description>

      <description>Sticky Jots is a set of storytelling sticky note paper and paper prototyping kits for designing mobile and tablet interfaces. The product is designed by Rae Milne and Pamela Jue, two grad students in the SVA Interaction Design program. 
Pam writes about the thinking behind Sticky Jots. The idea came from our constant prototyping and ideation process in almost every project this semester. While it’s great to do, it’s still frustrating how time consuming it can be.</description>

He&#39;s looking at how to employ practical ideas that satisfy the business side as well as the people using it, which I&#39;m sure is something we all want to do on sites that sell a product or service. He plans to publish the newsletter monthly.</description>

      <description>About this template This is a template for doing desktop application design using Sketch, a vector illustration tool for the Mac. The idea for sharing this template is to give a quick starting point for anyone who wants to create their visual design comps in Sketch. When I started using Sketch to design and export controls for an iOS app, I quickly started liking the application, particularly the styling properties, simple vector editing and combination features, and the well thought-out grid and export capabilities.</description>

      <description>Hammer is a static web site builder for the Mac that lets you build out sites quickly with no server side requirements.
Hammer does includes without PHP, compiles Coffeescript to JS, SASS/SCSS to CSS, has an auto-refresh feature for never having to reload the browser, and provides some simple to use helpers. Since it knows about all of the files in your projects, you just reference names and it knows how to build out paths.</description>

Main difference between Redacted and BLOKK (which the font is copies/is inspired by) is that Redacted uses smaller widths so your text blocks won&amp;rsquo;t end up wider than your normal font setting.

There is a technique using a special attribute that even allows you to inject behaviors without writing javascript.

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;m doing
I&amp;rsquo;m doing a review of customer support sites, looking mostly for software (desktop and web) and services-related sites that provide a customer support site for getting answers to questions, and viewing documentation and tutorials. Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it
Some sites have better search capabilities for questions than others. Other sites do well at presenting documentation. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that there&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a difference in how companies handle giving answers to the most granular questions as opposed to presenting a unified view of a product via a manual-like experience.</description>

      <description>Today I took my first mountain bike ride near my new home in Marin County. Humbled, mud splattered, and soaked from not making it through several streams, I paused to reflect on how different the place that I&#39;m in now is from where I was a year ago.
I spent a wonderful 3 months living on the side of a hill looking onto Mount Tamalpais in Marin with my family re-connecting with nature, and discovering the joy of living with only several bags of possessions and a new slate.</description>

      <description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description>

      <description>Have you ever done the dance of holding a sketch up to your computer&amp;rsquo;s webcam or taken pictures of them with your iPhone to email to yourself or to colleagues? I&amp;rsquo;ve done that sort of thing for all of the years that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely on design and development teams, because scanners get tired real fast. Frustrated with this process, I had largely given up, until a few months ago when I was looking for tools to share work on paper between students and teachers.</description>

I&#39;m writing this as I enter what I think may be my 17th year making web sites. The only thing I can say with each passing year is that what I know is still so very little compared to what I have yet to learn. Each time I learn of a new way of working I feel energized and excited about the work I do.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a lot of tools for transferring sketches from analog sketchbook to digital. I was an early Pen-It user, have used page cutters with a scanner, and have lately just resorted to taking photos with my iPhone. The Evernote/Moleskine Smart Notebook looks like it might provide the right mix I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.
I&#39;ve given up on the idea of converting paper sketches to vector drawings. What this seems to offer is the ability to use that dotted sheet tech to correctly line up your photos taken with Evernote app, and combines that with some neat stickers that will automatically route your sketches to tags and/or specific notebooks.</description>

      <description>Designers prune. Left to its own devices, the mob will augment, accessorize, spam, degrade and noisify whatever they have access to, until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. It seems democratic and non-elitist to set it and forget it and let the users take over. But the tools we use (Wikipedia) and the brands we covet (Nike or Ducati) resolutely refuse to become democracies.

      <description>Hannah Donovan&amp;rsquo;s essay in A List Apart considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.
I&#39;ve been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement.</description>

      <description>An Unexpected Ass Kicking Great post by Joel Runyon, who talks about getting schooled by Russel Kirsch. 2 takeaways: 1) Nothing is withheld from us which we have conceived to do. 2) Do things that have never been done. The first meaning: if you’ve conceived something in your mind, decide to do it, and are willing to put in the work – nothing can stop you. The second is fairly self-explanatory but carries the extra weight of it coming from the guy who invented the very thing that’s letting me type these words out on the internet.</description>

      <description>protomoto is an excellent showcase of prototyping or wireframing tools created to helps designers find a tool that&amp;rsquo;s suited to the specific devices or platforms they are designing for. The site, developed by Paper &amp;amp; Equator, will be adding more filters in the future as they continue to evolve the resource, so that you can browse the tools based on features. Very cool.

      <description>Sergey Chikuyonok&amp;rsquo;s Smashing Magazine article on PNG optimization is an oldie, but I just found myself returning to use it for maybe the 4th time since I originally read it. I don&amp;rsquo;t do web graphics so frequently anymore, so I always return here to get reminded of things like the posterization layer in Photoshop. See also Sergey&amp;rsquo;s JPEG Optimization article.

      <description>Telling yourself, “Oh, you have all the time in the world, you have all the money in the world, you have all the colors in the palette you want, anything you want,” I mean, that just kills creativity.
&amp;#8212;Jack White
I was going through the parts I had highlighted in my Kindle version of Austin Kleon&#39;s book, Steal Like An Artist, and I keep thinking of how much I like this quote from musician Jack White, talking about using constraints to stay creative.</description>

      <description>&#34;Getting the details right is the difference between something that delights, and something customers tolerate.&#34;
&amp;#8212;Jeff Atwood
I didn&#39;t read Jeff Atwood&#39;s article about cat feeders right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It&#39;s also a terrific demonstration of what he&#39;s saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to satisfice with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it.</description>

The collection can be browsed in HTML or via the PivotViewer Silverlight interface. PivotViewer provides a richer experience with faceted filtering, search, and hypertext links for metadata.</description>

      <description>People still occasionally ask me if I make the small bound Wireframe Sketchbooks, but I stopped selling them after a few years, and instead just posted instructions for how to make your own. I know that few people have the time or interest to do that, so I&#39;ve been looking at alternatives for them.
A month ago, Brad from JetPens contacted me to tell me that he started supplying a sketchbook from Maruman that I might like.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/bruce-springsteen-creativity/</guid>
      <description>I&#39;d like to talk about the one thing that&#39;s been consistent over the years—the genesis and power of creativity. ... It’s all about how you’re putting what you do together. The elements you’re using don’t matter. Purity of human expression and experience is not confined to guitars, to tubes, to turntables, to microchips. There’s no right way, no pure way of doing it—there’s just doing it.
From Bruce Springsteen&#39;s inspiring 2012 SXSW Keynote Speech.</description>

I started making my own sketchbooks and pads a few years ago. At the time there weren&#39;t many options for interface sketching and storyboarding.</description>

The site is restarting from scratch with new articles and examples of good and bad uses of color in terms of how those design decisions affect people with colorblindness. When you mouse over the examples, the screenshots allow you to compare the example with normal vison and simulated colorblindness. He also presents excellent examples for how these interfaces can be improved to become more accessible.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m certainly no stranger to being opinionated and argumentative. I&#39;ve put my foot in my mouth a few times by pushing back on others&#39; ideas, and am well aware that being quick to react can be detrimental. The older I get, the more I realize how little I know and how much more time I need to spend thinking after listening, before I open my mouth or start to type to respond.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the doers who do. 
I&amp;rsquo;ve never read Theodore Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Citizenship in a Republic/Man in the Arena&amp;rdquo; speech before hearing it in this BoS2011 recap video. &amp;ldquo;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</description>

The two groups have been working together to integrate Mockups into the UX StackExchange. You can now post Mockups wireframes with questions and answers to UX.StackExchange.com using the free integrated Mockups editor. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this. One of the conversations Peldi and I had before I joined Balsamiq was about creating something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to use for a long time&amp;ndash;a site where you could upload wireframes to vet ideas, get feedback, and test concepts with other peer professionals.</description>

      <description>I like the design of the La Wine Agency site. The beautiful large type on the off-white paper reminds me of letterpress cards.
One thing I loved immediately was the age gate, which asks you when you were born so you can get through to shop for wine.
Not only is the big text for the month/day/year picker friendly, but that goofy headlines and &amp;quot;When were you last born?&amp;quot; copy is hilarious, if you catch the joke.</description>

      <description>Simple things appeal to me. I like the simplicity of being able to usubscribe immediately. Zerply goes the extra mile and not only gives me options to never get email notifications via links in the notification itself, but also to change the frequency of updates. Nice.
1. Email notification from Zerply.2. Update frequency settings in the bottom. Click and you&amp;rsquo;re done.

They use a set of forms in a wizard-like survey to come up with an estimate of the number of slaves that are impacted by your behavior.
This section of the survey asks the user to drag the icons for items that describe the kind of house and car they own or rent into a drop area in the home above.</description>

      <description>Definitions Storyboarding is the technique interaction designers and information architects have adopted from film and animation to specify interaction in user interfaces. Storyboards in interaction design typically show a sequence of key frames that depict when a change in state occurs in the interface. They are often illustrated with a linear, multi-cell diagram, often accompanied by annotations to describe the actions taken by the user, and the responses or behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>I made a minor update to the OmniGraffle UX Template. The grids were screwed up in the last update I made, so snapping wasn&#39;t working. Some guides were also pretty sloppy, so I cleaned those up as well to keep things nice and neat.
Thanks to Jayson Elliot for the heads up about the grid snapping problem.

To use it, simply enter a full URL of your choosing. Up pops that location superimposed with a draggable set of rulers (x and y axis) configurable in center/left/and right alignment. These rulers allow you to view that site as it would be seen at different resolutions. So you can get a sense for what other eyeballs experience.</description>

“In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.</description>

I&#39;ve had Thomas Malone&#39;s 1981 paper, &#34;Heuristics for Designing Enjoyable Interfaces: Lessons from computer games&#34; on my desk for a while. I finally got around to reading it and found some interesting ideas that resonated with me.</description>

 &#34;Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don&#39;t necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve.&#34;

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about 3 years since I updated the printable graph paper PDFs I provide for user interface design sketching. You can download the printable PDFs from here. (Yes, I use the word &amp;quot;Here&amp;quot; in links.)
In the last year I&#39;ve gotten a lot of requests to replenish the inventory of wireframe and storyboard graphpaper notepads that I fulfilled via Amazon.com, and the wirebound sketch books. I feel bummed every time I tell people that I decided to get out of that little business.</description>

      <description>@nickf called me out for not having iPad templates in the Konigi OmniGraffle Wireframe Template, so I got off my lazy ass and added some since this thing hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in over 2 years! Added iPad Portrait 1 up, iPad Portrait 2 up, iPad Landscape 1 up. They have guides for 2x2 or 3x3 grid.
Note, this is for OmniGraffle Pro ONLY. You will not be able to edit shared layers to modify the headers and other templates.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin&#39;s blog often talks about where successful ideas come from, and in this post talks about bypassing the need to make huge leaps in innovation by synthesizing what we know and have learned from history, using Palm as the cautionary tale.
It&#39;s not enough to be aware of the domain you&#39;re working in, you need to understand it. Noticing things and being curious about how they work is the single most common trait I see in creative people.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m working on this hand drawn font and looking at characters with diacritics is having a weird effect on me. While working on it, the ö character reminded me of something from my childhood and I had to remake it in type.
So if you can guess what this is by @ing me on Twitter or in G+ if we follow each other there, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a floppy disk notebook from my stash, and a few sketch pads.</description>

      <description>I like how Seth Godin states everything so clearly. Usually it&#39;s a pithy piece of advice about how to do the right thing, do right by your product, and thereby do right for the market by serving the right users with the product they want, and forgetting about trying to serve everyone else.
Here&#39;s one thought about really knowing your use case and putting it out front for the market to see, and letting it guide your conversation.</description>

      <description>Persona is a concept for a theoretical email client prototyped by Ali Seçkin Karayol, Marco Triverio, and Harsha Vardhan at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design. The prototype focusses email on people or conversations rather than presenting the typical data-dense tabular view of messages. The attachment view also offers a nice way of viewing all attached files in a gallery presentation. There are some compelling ideas for re-imagining the focus of email consumption here.</description>

      <description>I like to use HR tags. I use the technique in the first example below, but occasionally want a nicer separator, and hate having to use a graphic to show that chiseled aqua-style divider or to created the faded line of a gradient. Examples 2 and 3 use background gradients in webkit and mozilla. All versions of IE just show the solid rule. Normal Demo HTML &amp;amp; CSS &amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Seth Godin&#39;s blog entry, &amp;quot;The Grateful Dead and the Top 40,&amp;quot; looks at a band that only ever had 1 &amp;quot;hit record,&amp;quot; but who were very succesful at what they did. They may have not hit the Top 40 more than once, but one thing is true, they knew themselves as artists, and were true to that.
In terms of chart success, Elton John is probably the polar opposite of The Grateful Dead.</description>

He explained that I should start working on a project as soon as it was assigned. An hour or so would do fine, he told me. He told me to come back to the project every day for at least a little bit and make progress on it slowly over time.</description>

      <description>Miratech observed the difference between reading an article in a newspaper and on an iPad in an eye tracking study. They concluded that readers are more likely to skim over articles on an iPad than in a newspaper.

The type of medium doesn&#39;t influence reading time when the text is short (like an article).
It is easier to assimilate and retain information read in a newspaper than on an iPad.</description>

      <description>Project Rimino is an interaction design project proposing a hypothetical e-paper mobile device. The project was created by Amid Moradganjeh, an interaction design student from Umea Institute of Design in Sweden, for his masters degree project on mobile experience design. The design is based on both observational and experimental design research methods. Watch the video below for the concept.

Some of the ideas are pretty exciting. I particularly like the emphasis on everyday tasks, utilizing the materials of the device to create minimal, task-focussed interfaces.</description>

      <description>Jared Spool talks about why designers who code are popular in Silicon Valley right now, and for the most part, it boils down to this. Small software and web startups value and are able to use a broader range of skillsets, because one of the highest priorities, especially for bootstrapped startups, is to ship while lean on resources.
Jared notes that those who don&#39;t think designers should know how to code say this dilutes the designer&#39;s value.</description>

      <description>Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about the role of UX designers as curators of content. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don&#39;t come off as content hackers.
I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.</description>

      <description>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”

      <description>Jumping in and immediately starting to build the product, even if it does get completed and ship, is almost guaranteed to produce a mediocre product in which there is little innovation or market differentiation. When you have only one kick at the can, the behaviour of the entire team and process is as predictable as it will be pedestrian.

      <description>Edistorm looks like an interesting tool for collaborative brainstorming. Group brainstorming sticky note boards (storms) can be set up with a background template, e.g. 5 up, SWOT, venn diagrams, etc. You place colored sticky notes with text, organize however you want, you can add +1 votes using a voting system, and add comments to notes. There&amp;rsquo;s some kind of recomendations feature that will suggest new topics, which I guess might only work well with certain content types.</description>

I mostly like to place them in sketchbooks to mark and annotate, but also like them for brainstorming and doing info organization exercises. Sticky notes for UI sketches and sketchboards makes sense.
The sticky notes are A5 sized, with light non-photo blue dot grid, and the browser version has 960gs markers.</description>

      <description>Best part of flickholdr, a placeholder image service that grabs images from flickr, is how you can string together an odd set of tags to get unusual placeholders.

      <title>Why Creative People Need to Be Eccentric</title>

      <description>I love these two posts by Mark McGuiness on the 99% on why eccentricity and how daily routine helps trigger creativity.
He points out three characteristics of a hypnotic trigger:
Uniqueness - it should be something (or a combination of things) you don&#39;t associate with other activities, otherwise the effect will be diluted.
Emotional intensity - the kind you experience when you&#39;re really immersed in creative work.
Repetition - the more times you experience the unique trigger in association with the emotions, the stronger the association becomes.</description>

      <description>Sketching interfaces is a path focussed on generating many ideas and finding the right design. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to adapt the activity of physically sketching on paper to get the same results in Mockups. On the Balsamiq UX blog, I wrote about a technique I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with to do sketchboards in Mockups using a Symbols library. http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2011/04/28/sketching-in-mockups/</description>

      <description>Cohdoo, the company that makes the iPhone whiteboard magnets that I&amp;rsquo;ve posted about have just released Highlight a nice iPhone app for voice recordings. It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at helping user researchers record interviews, and is just as useful for recording meetings and conference talks.
To start new sessions, press the New Recording button, and during the recording you can tap the huge green Mark Highlight button, which I could see being useful for marking new questions during interviews, or marking sections of conference talks.</description>

      <description>Pear Note from Useful Fruit Software is a powerful note-taking tool for Mac OS X. The application integrates text notes with audio and video you can record from interview sessions, meetings, etc.
The notes are time-marked to the video and slides that are being viewed during the recording, so you can click text from your notes, and the app will jump to that time in the recording so you can watch the video or see the slide that went with the note.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.youeye.com/&amp;lsquo;&amp;gt;YouEye looks interesting. The usability testing service allows you to create remote, unmoderated usability test sessions with a small number of tasks, and using the test participant&amp;rsquo;s web browser and web cam, they record eye-tracking results during the test. The service allows you to use paid self-identified test participants from different demographics. Would hope that you could recruit your own testers as well.

Occasionally I&#39;m asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I&#39;m familiar with.</description>

      <description>Cohdoo makes a nice iPhone UI sketching product called Phone Doos. They are 6.8&amp;quot; by 3.5&amp;quot; dry erase iPhone surfaces with faint grid lines and magnetic backing. A pack contains 10 Phone Doos.
I like that these gives you a surface to work on that can be re-arranged easily on a table and presented on a metallic wall. They have some good screenshots using them arranged on a whiteboard with flow arrows pointing between them, which is another thing that&#39;s probably much easier with these as opposed to using paper.</description>

      <description>Don Lehman&amp;rsquo;s MORE/REAL Stylus Cap is a cool iPad stylus project looking for funding via Kickstarter. The idea is to create a cap with a conductive tip that will fit over a Sharpie, Bic, or Fineliner pen. Lehman&amp;rsquo;s introductory video below shows the stylus cap at work.
 Looks fantastic and simple, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have one fewer thing to carry with you because it acts as pen and stylus. Sweet. You can help fund the project and reserve a cap by heading to the Kickstarter page.</description>

      <description>Ryan Singer at 37signals explains code refactoring to designers so that they can use it correctly in a design context.
Designers sometimes use the word “refactor” in a loose way. I think they overhear the word from programmers without getting the precise meaning. This article will introduce the term to designers so they can gain the same advantages that programmers have from a clear understanding.
How do designers loosely understand refactoring?</description>

      <description>Wirify is a bookmarklet that lets you turn any web page into a wireframe in one click. Similar to the Web Without Words, it converts all of the elements on a web page to gray boxes, so you can visualize the page as a schematic without content.  This reminds me of a a technique used in painting and design where one steps back a distance from the canvas or screen and blurs the eyes to get a view of the placement of parts of the design, the relationship of the parts to each other, the white space, and the hierarchy of elements.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on Paul Irish and Divya Manian&amp;rsquo;s HTML5 Boilerplate after looking for a solution to fall back on a local jQuery library if Google&amp;rsquo;s CDN ever went south, and reading about how to use this technique for WordPress. Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq&amp;rsquo;s site.
HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites.</description>

      <title>Word Lens: Translation using Augmented Reality</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/word-lens-translation-using-augmented-reality/</guid>
      <description>This is one of the most practical uses of augmented reality I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Word Lens translates text you capture from an iPhone&amp;rsquo;s camera to another language. I think it&amp;rsquo;s only Spanish-English/English-Spanish at the moment, and $4.99 per language. If you&amp;rsquo;re skeptical, as some YouTubers seem to be in the comments, you can see an example of the translation I did on my phone of an English magazine page to Spanish.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 11&amp;frasl;30, Blue Beanie day. It’s easy to show your support for web design done right. Beg, borrow, or buy a Blue Beanie and snap a photo of your mug wearing the blue. (Or get creative with Photoshop). Then on November 30, switch your profile picture in Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, (and any other social network) and post your photo to the Blue Beanie Day group.

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve release Mockups 2.0 at Balsamiq. The main feature in this release is the Symbols functionality. It allows you to reuse groups of controls in order to create templates, page masters, and libraries of re-usable components. This can be done globally for all of your projects, or locally within a single project. You can create symbols from the top down and the bottom up. There&amp;rsquo;s some documentation for this somewhat advanced feature here: Working with Symbols.</description>

      <description>The iClooly is the pen I&amp;rsquo;ve been using most for quick sketches on the iPad, but for longer sketches and for drawing the handwritten font I&amp;rsquo;m making in iFontMaker, the short stick kind of sucks. Extending the iClooly stick is an easy hack that almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t merit a post: rip off the back, take apart a mechanical pencil, and mash the two together.
Verbose version: Remove the clicky end and the spring inside, making sure the brush is pressed down and the bristles exposed.</description>

      <description>Sarah Sampsel wrote about designing the Washington Post iPad app, in 2 entries describing a little bit about the process. The first entry describes the types of interaction, visual design, and brand issues she had to consider when designing for the device. The second shows a few wireframes of the evolution of the home screen design.
Would have been lovely to also see some of the sketches, but it&#39;s awesome that Sarah shared not just final wireframes, but a series of wireframes showing the iterations.</description>

      <description>Chance favors the connected mind.
I just picked up Steven Berlin Johnson&#39;s Where Good Ideas Come From after watching this sketch-note summarization of the ideas in the book.
 I became a fan of Steven&#39;s after reading the New Yorker article &#34;Watching TV Makes you Smarter&#34; and his book, Everything Bad is Good for You. This one looks like it will be an interesting read. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s full of stories of long drawn out infancy of ideas, and the collisions and connections that make ideas succeed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using some new CSS techniques lately, and thought it was time to start experimenting with ideas. One thing that I thought was really cool was that you could use the :before and :after pseudo-classes to create boxes before and after an element and position those. I did that on the little screenshot images on this product page, to position the little + icons.
I was also interested in how I could replace some of the jQuery techniques I was using to make tooltips in myBalsamiq.</description>

      <description>Love this post on /Film showing a few artifacts from J.K. Rowling&amp;rsquo;s creative process. Rowling uses spreadsheets she draws by making grid lines on plain paper, creating columns to outline a book&amp;rsquo;s plot along a timeline, with months progressing downward. The initial columns contains a title and blurb about the plot, and further columns contain info about sub-plots. The excerpt below describes this in detail:
Rowling outlines each chapter in detail including which month of the school year it takes place in, the title and the plot.</description>

      <description>Fillerati is a fun greeking/dummy text alternative if you&amp;rsquo;re not into lorem ipsum, but would love some literary copy. Select an author (Edgar Rice Burroughs, Herman Melville, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells) and title, and choose an excerpt rendered in html (h1, p, or li) or plain text. A slick slider UI lets you choose the number of words to include in your text. Grab some Fillerati.

If you know me, you know that I dig getting to do more than one thing, so that&amp;rsquo;s a win.</description>

      <description>Definitions Dark Patterns are interface design patterns that have been designed to trick users into doing things they wouldn’t otherwise have done.
The term was coined by Harry Brignull, who writes on DarkPatterns.org, that they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. In the talk Brignull gave at UX Brighton 2010, he calls for a code of ethics among professionals in the user interface design industries, and for professional associations to acknowledge that these practices are unethical.</description>

      <description>Jakub Linowski created a sketch annotation system for interaction design and provides a free downloadable PDF describing how to use it.
&amp;quot;The interactive sketching notation is an emerging visual language which affords the representation of interface states and event-based user actions. Through a few simple and standardized rules, what the user sees (drawn in greys and blacks) and does (drawn in red) are unified into a coherent sketching system. This unification of both interface and use, intends to enable designers to tell more powerful stories of interaction.</description>

      <description>Wireframes Mag pointed to an XML to OmniGraffle Sitmap Generator created by Jason Kunesh at Fuzzy Math to generate a sitemap from an XML file. The script assumes that your XML file consists of url elements, and that parent child relationships are defined by the paths in the url. For instance, http://konigi.com/about-site/unicorns would be a child of http://konigi.com/about-site. Once you generate a list of your urls and pass it to the script, OmniGraffle generates the sitemap hierarchy for you.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re curious about Keynote prototyping, Travis Isaacs&#39; describes how he works with the presentation software to produce click-through prototypes. As Travis notes, it&#39;s even useful to people who like to go between a low-fidelity wireframe created in another application to interactive demonstrations.

      <title>WhatUsersDo.com Review on 90 Percent of Everything</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</guid>
      <description>Harry Brignull did a thorough review of WhatUsersDo.com, a UK-based remote, unmoderated, qualitative usability testing service. To use the service, you pay £25-£30 per participant and you get back screen recordings with audio of them thinking aloud during the tasks. The test participants are chosen from a pool of users paid to take usability tests, similar to usertesting.com.
As Brignull notes, this is possibly valuable to companies with little experience doing usability testing on their own before, but is less likely to be of value to companies with the experience and budget for doing moderated usability research on their own, or with a usability research consultancy.</description>

      <description>Quplo may be the most promising HTML prototyping tools I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for UX designers who know a little HTML and would like to do HTML prototyping, but either don&amp;rsquo;t have the chops to build the interaction by hand, or are lazy like me.
The web-based tool allows you to build multiple prototypes using a combination of standard HTML/CSS. If you can do JS, the standard JS libraries are available to include in your pages (or sheets in Quplo lingo).</description>

      <description>Touch Notation is a simple annotation system created by Matt Gemmell for documenting multi-touch gestures. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly simple system when compared to the more literal annotation symbols that use hands, because the symbology can be quickly rendered in sketches as well as being used in wireframing libraries.
The Touch Notation page provides PSD, AI, and OmniGraffle templates. I&#39;ve additionally created a Balsamiq Mockups version of the system on Mockups To Go.</description>

      <description>I swear I&#39;ve answered this question a dozen times, so I&#39;m capturing to refer people in the future. The tree control in my OmnGraffle Wireframe Stencil is a godawful hack that uses tabs and arrow characters. Copying and pasting the arrows, however, screws up the formatting. OmniGraffle just doesn&#39;t make this kind of manipulation of text all that easy and I haven&#39;t found an ideal solution, but if you want to learn how I do it, read on.</description>

The more I deal with the work as something of my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is as something that is compelling, interesting, and sustaining.</description>

1. It&#39;s important to know who is in charge. Just like training a pet, a designer need to establish a rapport with clients that mixes trust and expertise.
2. Pay attention to the tail.</description>

The graph below shows a snapshot of current support and intent to support in web browsers. Shows that IE is well behind the field in terms of readiness as we speak, but IE 9 intends to support.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see more people showing how they explore ideas with sketches and wireframes.

I came across the odd design of the iClooly and thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out of curiosity.
I had low expectations, but was surprised by how well it works for iPad sketching.</description>

      <title>Hacking a Pogo Stylus for Smoother iPad Sketching</title>

      <description>I blogged about what I thought could possibly make a better stylus recently and thought I&amp;rsquo;d sketch what I was thinking. The above picture shows how I think you could hack the Pogo Sketch stylus so it will glide a little more smoothly on the iPad screen. The capacitive foam creates a little too much friction to feel natural to me. I drilled a small hole in the foam and inserted a plastic nib from an old pressure-sensitive screen stylus into the center.</description>

      <description>Pen and paper are still superior, but iPad sketching is good enough to leave those behind.
The topic of UI sketching on the iPad is coming up pretty regularly for UI designers. People want to know how it feels and if it&#39;s going to replace pen/pencil and paper. After a few months using as many drawing apps as I can get my hands on, I find that it&#39;s more than adequate for UI sketching needs.</description>

      <description>The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness.
Peldi pointed me to a video of Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s presentation at Business of Software 09, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It&amp;rsquo;s about user benefits, and not features&amp;ndash;about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.</description>

      <description>I was chatting with UX friends Matt and Mark when the topic of taste came up. Mark brought up the Ira Glass Storytelling series of videos, which are great. If you haven&#39;t seen it, there&#39;s a great discussion on taste for creators. This is Ira Glass from This American Life talking about story telling, and how we get into creative work because we love it and we have good taste. He talks about the gap in the beginning when we&#39;re trying to make stuff, that turns out short of our expectations.</description>

      <title>Shades of Grey: Wireframes as Thinking Device</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/shades-grey-wireframes-thinking-device/</guid>
      <description>Will Evans writes for UX Mag about his process for creating wireframes, or more precisely how he uses wireframes for ideation and problem solving. Will breaks his design process into three phases: divergence, transformation, and convergence.
This seems similar to a common theme I come across when designers talk about their process&amp;ndash;framing/ideating, reframing/ideating, selection/refining. Buxton also refers to this, citing Stuart Pugh&amp;rsquo;s idea by illustrating the expanding/contracting nature of a designer&amp;rsquo;s concept selection, which I find easy to map to sketching-&amp;gt;wireframing as well.</description>

      <description>With the glut of anti-craft sentiment I hear and read so often, I think it fitting to post an entry about the love of one&#39;s work, drawing from a craft outside of our own.
UP THERE is a beautiful documentary about the slow, laborious, and fading craft of hand-painted advertising murals. This is the NY I love. This is the type of appreciation of craft that I admire.
 I feel like the humble young man towards the end that looks at it this way.</description>

      <description>Because of @fred_beecher I setup this iPad Sketch Group on Flickr so we can share our UI sketches. I&#39;m going to slowly post what I work on there.
Freehand design sketching on the iPad is for UX designers. Any app that lets you do freehand user interface sketches, either using finger tips or a capacitive stylus like the Pogo Sketch is what we&#39;re sharing here. If you drop non-iPad sketches, they will be booted.</description>

The good news is that Jeff Parks did an amazing job of capturing the sessions and producing audio podcasts, which are now available via Boxes and Arrows or by subscribing to the podcast via iTunes. Currently the keynotes and all of the sessions from Day 1 are available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling people how much I dig Adobe&amp;rsquo;s free Ideas app and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for sketching on the iPad. Craighton Berman&amp;rsquo;s Fueled by Coffee sketchblog will give you an idea of what sketches can look like using these tools. Ideas is super simple and smoothens your lines so things look naturally drawn.
I&#39;m really loving it. The adjustment is taking time, and it&#39;s not as quick as pen and paper, but it&#39;s slightly more natural using a Pogo Sketch Stylus.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/wireframe-kit-google-drawings/</guid>
      <description>Morten Just created wireframe templates using the new drawing tools available for Google Docs. The illustration tools in Docs gives you basic shapes you need to create UI elements that can be combined and grouped to create components. The biggest advantage is that since it&amp;rsquo;s document authoring in the Docs cloud, you can do collaborative editing.
For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t think this is ideal, but it is interesting because of the online collaboration.</description>

      <description>I love the idea of Design Swap, even if it reminds me of Wife Swap, key parties, the swinging &amp;lsquo;70s and that movie Ice Storm. It&amp;rsquo;s better, because it&amp;rsquo;s an exhibitionist, one-to-one CSS Zen Garden style swap of designs between two designer&amp;rsquo;s sites. And we get to be the voyeurs. Salacious.
It&#39;s a shame that they didn&#39;t pick up on the wife swap theme like I did, and go with a &#39;70s disco, swinging aesthetic.</description>

In the video he illustrates for us how sketching is just combining forms and lines, and all you really need to be able to come up with pictures is to see and use these basic shapes.

      <description>Jon Phillips writes about how the user experience of restaurant flow can be redesigned by illustrating the flow in a cafeteria-style space from entry, order and pickup to seating and exit. In his great diagrams he shows how the orginal flow frustrated diners (users) and could be easily re-designed to consider a flow that was immediately understandable&amp;ndash;the design he experienced made him feel stupid. Sound familiar?
I think about interior spaces like lines at Whole Foods, where sometimes it makes absolutely no sense (I&#39;m looking at you Columbus Circle) and where other lines seem to have considered this (Union Square sometimes feels efficient).</description>

      <description>Jennifer Bove writes for Fast Company about how she and Bill DeRouchey designed the conference experience in &amp;quot;Interaction10: How to Design an Experience for Experience Designers.&amp;quot; It&amp;rsquo; a great behind the scenes look at how they observed the event the year prior, and thought about every aspect of the attendee experience and designed the IXD10 event to create a service that caters to what&amp;rsquo;s important to the conference-goer at every point.</description>

      <description>Roberto Verganti&#39;s article in HBR, &amp;quot;User-Centered Innovation Is Not Sustainable,&amp;quot; discusses how focussing on what user&#39;s say they want isn&#39;t a strategy for innovation. Not news to you, but his take looks at what that means regarding innovation from a sustainability perspective. I found it thought-provoking in other ways as well. The main idea is this. Forward-looking designers and business or policy decision makers may have a greater role and influence regarding designing sustainability products than customers.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a little late on getting to this one, but wanted to post before I forgot because it is a great topic for early and mid-career web designers. Matt (emenel) reacted to Mark Boulton&#39;s thoughts about whether or not designers needed to know html.
Matt summarizes what he believes:
As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making.</description>

User experiences are your everyday experiences—anything from operating a car, to making a pot of coffee, to ordering a pair of shoes online. User experience is the result of your interactions with a product or service, specifically how it’s delivered and its related artifacts according to the design.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the 5 second test, a lot web-based services have cropped up to support remote usability testing. In the past few years, I&#39;ve been experimenting with some of these to conduct super small, unmoderated remote usability testing sessions. I&#39;ve used Morae extensively in the past, but for most of my needs, that&#39;s like using a sledgehammer on a pushpin.
I&#39;d been successful using fivesecondtest and Usabilla, who decided to sponsor me after I participated in the beta and gave feedback.</description>

      <description>About Web accessibility Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users can have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large and/or enlargable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to checking out the Interaction Design Association (IXDA) site relaunch, which has been redesigned and migrated to the Drupal platform. The IXDA has one of the most impressive list archives for professional association that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used, and the new features provided by this platform open up a host of new notification options. There are a few more browsing options in the discussion area, a resource library, and what looks like a redesigned job board.</description>

      <description>The Kelley Blue Book features Mad Libs-style inline form elements for its contact form.

Update:
Shortly after posting this, David Kaneda pointed out his post, in which he observes that there is quite a bit more to that Kelly Blue Book form redesign than just switching from vertically arranged fields to inline fields.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the downtime. Konigi went down for most of the day yesterday because a spike in traffic and number of database requests caused the databases to be taken offline. With our web host&#39;s help, we&#39;ve moved Konigi to a virtual private server, and now we&#39;re able to run our own database rather than share database resources and limit the number of requests we can make. These are all good problems, and the growing pains are to be expected I suppose.</description>

      <description>Will Evans shows us how he sketches and wireframes interfaces in this cool video, which is a nice preview of what you may see in his upcoming talk on &amp;ldquo;The Right Way to Wireframe&amp;rdquo; at IXD10. Incidentally, he&amp;rsquo;s using OmniGraffle with our free wireframe stencils. Will says this about wireframing:
Increasingly, as designers of interactive systems (spaces, processes and products for people), we find ourselves stretching the limits of communication tools to explore and document what it will be like to interact with the things we design.</description>

      <description>Craig Villamor and Luke Wroblewski summarize the new interactions we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing in the iPad.
During Apple&#39;s 90 minute unveiling of the iPad this week, a lot of new multi-touch interactions were shown off. But they went by fast. So as a service to digital product designers everywhere, we took the time to extract 8 minutes of new user interface demos from the iPad keynote. Now you can quickly just catch the UI in action on Apple&#39;s new native iPad and iWork applications.</description>

      <description>Napkee gets an update with iPhone controls and now covers 100% of what you find in Balsamiq Mockups. What I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about are the export settings. Under the HTML settings you can now define a title for your exported files, a new name for the Icons folder and you can specify an external CSS file that will be included in each export.

      <description>Instead of throwing in my 2 cents on the &amp;quot;wireframes suck&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lorem ipsum ain&amp;rsquo;t so bad&amp;quot; discussions I&amp;rsquo;ll just echo what Joshua Porter (@bokardo) has to say on the matter:
Lorem Ipsum, wireframes, personas, etc are just tactics. The only thing that matters is: Do people love what you built?
Amen, brother. Here&#39;s 1 cent... I agree with Karen about Lorem Ipsum.

Changes are updated on the fly, so you can see your style changes as you write them.
The CSS generated by your edits can then be generated and copy-pasted into your stylesheet file for minor edits.</description>

The paid version gets rid of upgrade reminders, allows you to export to Basecamp, import libraries, and install on multiple machines.

This is an interesting looking tool that lets you create HTML wireframes using a web interface. You specify your grid, then insert one of the pre-defined UI components into the page. An inspector lets you modify the component attributes. There isn&amp;rsquo;t any information about who is responsible for this tool and if it&amp;rsquo;s merely an experiment or a demo of something we can expect to see in an application or framework.</description>

What is it? Why is it important? What does it mean to you? Some folks may offer a definition in 140 characters or less, while others will use this opportunity to tell a story (using text, pictures, audio, and/or video) about their relationship to IA.</description>

      <description>Rosenfeld Media have a book site and Ning community up for John Ferrara&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming book, Playful Design: Creating Game Expderiences in Everyday Interfaces.
Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they&#39;re siblings that grew up in different houses. They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do this in the past too, to just limit to sources I trust.</description>

      <description>Drawter has been sitting in my tabs for a few days now, and I keep coming back to play with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website&#39;s code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div&#39;s style properties within floating inspectors.</description>

      <description>BiDi Screen was demonstrated at SIGGRAPH Asia this year. It is a thin, depth-sensing LCD for 3D interaction using light fields.
The BiDi Screen is an example of a new type of I/O device that possesses the ability to both capture images and display them. This thin, bidirectional screen extends the latest trend in LCD devices, which has seen the incorporation of photo-diodes into every display pixel. Using a novel optical masking technique developed at the Media Lab, the BiDi Screen can capture lightfield-like quantities, unlocking a wide array of applications from 3-D gesture interaction with CE devices, to seamless video communication.</description>

      <description>Iain Lamb&amp;rsquo;s Typograph is cool tool that allows you to explore the relationship between scale and rhythm by modifying the properties of typographic elements in a page of sample text.
It sets out to explore how two, intertwined concepts, often playful but sometimes cheeky, can be encouraged to dance in web pages. Drag the colored boxes along the scale to throw these words anew. For the most part, this text is just a libretto for the performance you are about to play upon it.</description>

      <description>Masonry is a layout plugin for jQuery. Think of it as the flip side of CSS floats. Whereas floating arranges elements horizontally then vertically, Masonry arranges elements vertically then horizontally according to a grid. The result minimizes vertical gaps between elements of varying height, just like a mason fitting stones in a wall.

      <description>The OmniGraffle Wireframe Icons and the Royalty Free EPS/PNG icons have been updated.
In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I&#39;ve cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description>

      <description>CSS and Javascript experiments are fun to play around with. I tend to talk about them here because of the questions they raise about whether a technique is worth implementing or if it does more harm than help. Straight forward and familiar are the safe route. Sometimes experiments lead to better ways of doing things, other times they seem like they&amp;rsquo;re gratuitous.
I came across an interesting, if problematic experiment to convert form fields into editable fields that are masked table cells until each input is in focus.</description>

      <description>I finally made some time to read through Luke Wroblewski&amp;rsquo;s excellent review of the changes in the Apple store&amp;rsquo;s redesigned checkout form. According to Wroblewski, &amp;quot;&amp;hellip;retail sales data shows that Mac sales were up 21% year-over-year in the months of October and November. So it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that Apple&amp;rsquo;s primary online sales channel (Web-based checkout) was redesigned during this time.
I wasn&#39;t surprised that the single page checkout form is an improvement over the paged version.</description>

      <description>Google Browser Size is a visualization of browser window sizes for web sites. Enter a URL into the app, and the page is displayed behind an overlay showing the percentage of browser users who are able to view the visible portion, based on their browser&amp;rsquo;s available viewport size, and their display&amp;rsquo;s screen resolution. For example, the &amp;quot;90%&amp;quot; contour means that 90% of people visiting the site have their browser window open to at least this size or larger.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&#39;ve been working on an html prototyping toolkit that&#39;s in its infancy, and available to play with in pre-release form here on Konigi. What you also may know is that I hope to put the code in a repository so that people can contribute UI component markup/css/js to it, but what I&#39;ve got is not mature enough yet.
A few people have already started sharing their ideas and tips with me and I&#39;ve felt like it&#39;s kind of a waste to have some of these discussions happen offline, so I want to step out and start these discussions in a wider venue.</description>

      <description>Basil Safwat does a very thorough comparison of the the tabs in Mac Safari and Chrome, pointing out the subtleties in the close button positioning and behavior. While Mac close icons are on the left by convention, Chrome positions them to the right of the tab and keeps them visible, while Safari positions them to the left and only displays the close icon on hover. I initially had to relearn the close button position because Firefox also places them on the right.</description>

      <description>The Plan I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of two things a lot with the holidays arriving. The first is, how can I provide a discount on Konigi stuff to my friends who use the notepads and sketchbooks. The second is, how can I find a way to make my Christmastime donations interesting. When I was an avid Lala trader a few years ago, I tried to see if I could get one of the many CDs sleeves I marked back and vowed to make my donations coincide with the event.</description>

      <description>This an article from March 09 by Kevin Vigneault of Viget that explores some techniques using Javascript to create more usable password inputs in forms. The ideas range from using a checkbox or button to temporarily show the password or changing type from text to password when the input is not in focus. Great ideas.

Uses the familiar I&amp;rsquo;m a customer/I&amp;rsquo;m new here radios that we know from Amazon, but positions it before the password field, which I find an improvement over the Amazon implementation. Lots of ideas in the comments.

Using Templates I&amp;rsquo;m using a jQuery template for creating columns in a grid. Columns look like this:

 {cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; grid layout container {col12} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column {/col} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; closed column {col12last} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column last in container {/col} {/cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; end of container  You can try out the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;m playing with here:</description>

      <description>Simon Collison writes about the different forms of prototyping in ErskineLabs&amp;rsquo; Process Toolbox, describing the benefits of paper, wireframe, and browser prototypes.
As much as all parties may talk about requirements and argue over features, often they won’t really “get it” until they can see the concept represented visually, and understand its exact behaviour. This brings us on to various methods of prototyping.

      <description>This is fantastic presentation from Pentagram&amp;rsquo;s Michael Bierut at The 99 Percent conference. Shows how a quiet, humble, and empathetic bedside manner can be such useful attributes in a designer.
Renowned graphic designer Michael Bierut claims that he&amp;rsquo;s not creative. Instead, he likens his job to that of a doctor who tends to patients – &amp;ldquo;the sicker, the better.&amp;rdquo; Digging into the 86 notebooks he&amp;rsquo;s kept over the course of his career, Bierut walks us through 5 projects – from original conception to final execution – extracting a handful of simple lessons (e.</description>

      <description>How I try and occasionally succeed at finding focus.
Ambient information and notification is killing me; so much so I&#39;m mostly avoiding email, I&#39;m disabling Growl notifications for apps, and looking at stuff like Tweetie on my own time rather than leaving it always on. I have to admit that I occasionally have a hard time focusing on tasks and have sometimes put more effort into tweaking my systems for getting things done than I should.</description>

The Costanza Principle There&#39;s a particularly funny episode of Seinfeld titled &#34;The Abstinence,&#34; where George abstains from sex because his girlfriend has Mono, and strange things begin to happen to the serial underachiever. He appears to utilize more of his brain and becomes mentally sharp. He remembers where he left things years ago.</description>

      <description>Definitions A wireframe is a schematic or other low-fidelity rendering of a computer interface, intended to primarily demonstrate functionality, features, content, and user flow without explicitly specifying the visual design of a product. Wireframes may function as interface specification for products such as computer applications, web and mobile sites, and all products requiring some form of human-computer interaction. While wireframes are considered the equivalent of an architect&amp;rsquo;s blueprints, they are typically not meant to be a representation of visual design.</description>

They did this by simply requiring that real eggs be used in making cakes, rather than incorporating powered egg, and marketed this as a benefit.</description>

We present a system that composes a realistic picture from a simple freehand sketch annotated with text labels. The composed picture is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement
with the sketch and text labels; these are found by searching the Internet.</description>

      <description>Peter Bregman writes about how finding the simplest solution provides the most effective path to change. In his story he talks about how changing one thing, one habit or pattern of behavior, permitted him to be effective at losing weight. This simple strategy contrasts with the multitude of diet books that suggest entire regimine of change in order to lose weight.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great tale that Bregman uses to illustrate how simplifying a process or dealing with a challenge can sometimes be most effectively handled by reducing it to its essence, and devoting 100% of energy on a singular action.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m becoming more and more intrigued by the latest offering of inexpensive touch screen PCs like the MSI Wind Top that have been released recently, as well as the rumored Apple Tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the penetration of touch interfaces on higher resolution desktop applications, which will start to spread at a much greater rate to a wider audience when we see low cost devices like tablets and touch screen desktops at netbook prices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had SketchBook Pro for the Mac for a few years now. I bought it before it was acquired by Autodesk from Alias, mostly for art work, but also to experiment with it as a tool for interface sketching. But while I wanted to use it more, I find myself falling back on paper and pencil almost all of the time. Autodesk recently released iPhone versions of the app (1 version is free, and the full version is $2.</description>

      <description>Caterina Fake, founder of Flickr and Hunch, talks about why working hard isn&amp;rsquo;t as important as working on the right things. Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;you have to work smarter not harder.&amp;rdquo;
Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/john-maeda-simplicity-apple-and-future-design/</guid>
      <description>John Maeda wrote a short article for Huffington Post about simplicity and humanizing design, what it has meant for the software developed on Apple products, and what it means for the future. The respect so many designers have for Apple is possibly bourne out of reverence for the philosophies that lead to reduction, simplicity, and the humanizing of user interfaces. Maeda talks about Jonathan Ive in this regard, citing his ability to make something real and human by getting his hands dirty.</description>

The apparel store shows t-shirt listings, and a little cart dock at the bottom of the page that invites visitors to drag t-shirts down into it to add to cart. Clicking and dragging shows the ghosted t-shirt moving with the cursor until it snaps into the dock.</description>

      <description>The paper prototype is generally used as a design tool and even usability testing tool, but the folks at IG Index have figured out a creative way to use sketches and paper prototypes as a communication tool in place of wireframes for demonstrating interaction to development teams. Martin Belam posted video from UX London 09 of Jane Austin, Chris Neale and Frances Eida discussing this simple method of taking wireframe/storyboard sketches or paper prototypes, and creating stop-motion animation to demonstrate interface.</description>

      <description>Larva Labs&amp;rsquo; Intelligent Home Screen is a home screen replacement for Google Android devices that provides an information stream or feed. It divides the stream into 2 panels: private information on top (messages, calendar events) and public information on bottom (stock quotes, news). It provides color-coded category markers, and a draggable menubar that allows the user to selectively change the volume of information between top and bottom lists, and when pushed to a single end, provides focus on that category.</description>

      <description>Fred Beecher did an informal usability test of 2 conversion apps for the iPhone&amp;ndash;Convert and Covertbot&amp;ndash;and wrote up a thought provoking review regarding the relationship between playfulness and usability. Convertbot could be viewed as the more playful and whimsical of the 2 apps. He writes:
Fun isn’t always the new usable. There are situations in which usability is more important than playfulness and those in which it’s the other way around.</description>

Often, usability testing only reveals flaws with the interaction and interface elements.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;ve continued to make improvements to the app, with the help of our feedback. They&amp;rsquo;ve also posted new information on their site to familiarize users with their product. This is a review of my recent test with the latest revisions.
Creating Tests The process is still quite simple: 1) Create a new test, 2) Add pages to test either from images you upload or using URLs, 3) Use the pre-defined tasks and add your own tasks, 4) Invite users to participate.</description>

      <description>Generally speaking I have 2 gripes with wireframes. One is that they&#39;re very limited and come with issues in terms of communicating design. Secondly, they&#39;re not fast and flexible enough as communication artifacts.
HTML wireframes and prototypes provide some relief from some of the issues, and I&#39;d like to hear what other people are looking for when doing HTML wireframes in order to fix and overcome the limitations of wireframes made in graphics software.</description>

      <description>Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.
The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way.</description>

I noticed, however, that they kept the slight (3px?) rounding of names in the To: field of the messaging section. That somehow feels like a natural place for an exception to rounding corners for some reason. You know, so you don&amp;rsquo;t get impaled when backspacing in the field. Kidding. This is a quote from their announcement.</description>

      <description>Brandon Walkin&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Managing UI Complexity&amp;rdquo; offers some excellent pointers or reminders of concepts and techniques that help reduce complexity in an interface, including progressive diclosure, contextual actions, aligment and hierarchy. There&amp;rsquo;s an abundance of examples with screenshots and deconstruction of interfaces to demonstrate the techniques in practice.

      <description>TechSmith, makers of Morae and Snagit, have released a Mac version of Camtasia, the screencast video recording software. The software allows you to capture the screen, audio and iSight input, and provides simple drag and drop editing including a lot of built-in transitions and effects. You can then easily export the HTML and SWF for embedding in a web page. Looks like an easy to use alternative that might take the work out of producing screencasts.</description>

      <description>[I]f you make it easy to talk to me, I will immediately be a lot more likely to keep talking.
Zeus Jones has a great write up about using conversational language and cues to invite users through interactions. The deconstruction of the lazy trial/registration process in Tumblr is used to demonstrate how this type of engagement makes the learning process natural and inviting. The discussion picks up on the Cluetrain meme of markets as conversations, positing that systems are conversations, and turning front ends into actors that use conversational language as interface.</description>

      <description>Keith Lang, co-founder of plasq.com, wrote a fantastic article for Think Vitamin about UX Myths. It&amp;rsquo;s full of references and examples debunking stuff we hear repeated enough times that they begin to go unquestioned.
The top 10 UX myth list:
 The Design Has to be Original People Read People Know What They Like Design Always with Implementation in Mind Can’t Decide? Make it a Preference If you Have Great Search, You Don’t Need Great Information Architecture UX Design Stops at the Edges of the Product Design to Avoid Clicks People Don’t Change If the Design is a Good One, You Don’t Need to Test It  Some of these become so ingrained, that it takes a lot of effort to convince clients or colleagues otherwise.</description>

      <description>Janko at Warp Speed demonstrates a technique using jQuery to provide a navigable table of contents menu using the headings in your page content. I particularly like the method he&amp;rsquo;s come up with for displaying headings to show the proportion of content for each section relative to the whole. I think you could do some nice styling to display the blocks as small multiples of proportion and scale in the margin.</description>

To start off, you build your series of wireframes in Mockups, optionally creating links between pages. The screenshot below shows a wireframe of a fictional news site I created to try it out. I mocked up a site home page, and a login screen for my test.</description>

The examples illustrate how gestural interfaces are hidden, and lack the affordances of physical buttons. But the real story here is how the iPhone brings one thing to the experience that is more important than usability&amp;#8212;fun.</description>

A pull down menu to the right of the search input displays options for searching everything, or restricting to media types, users, or just updates. The options are displayed as circles, and should function as radios.</description>

On the results page, a simpler search form is displayed at the top of the page.</description>

      <description>The page description diagram is a design artifact developed by Dan Brown to take design out of wireframes by describing content areas of the page. The approach provides functional specifications and interaction requirements, and lays out blocks of content without limiting the designer&#39;s ability to make decisions in the visual design. They are not necessarily meant to replace wireframes, but may be used in conjunction with them

 A Deep Understanding of Human Psychology &amp;amp; Research Methods Competence in the Basics of Graphic Design An Awareness of and Interest in Technology Verbal &amp;amp; Visual Communication Skills Moderate Familiarity with Business, Deep Familiarity with Your Business The Ability to Quickly Learn a Subject Matter Area Mediation, Facilitation, &amp;amp; Translation Skills Creativity &amp;amp; Vision Passion  Elizabeth Buie also added a familiarity with HCI literature, and undboubtedly with HCI history, which I think should be there as well.</description>

      <description>Plasq designer, Keith Lang, recounts the story from computer folklore of how the rounded rectangle came to dominate the Mac OS, and discusses its effect on visual cognition. He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of Visual Perception to offer his opinion.
A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle.</description>

So you’re thinking about becoming a designer? If I could tell you only one thing about going into the field, my advice would be ___________ .
 The suggestions ranged from the philosophical to the pragmatic. Below are the ones that resounded with me. Focus on empathy and understanding problems  Being empathetic helps designers create things that move people.</description>

The agency was contracted to abandon the prior touch screen/solid state UI, and transform the software to work with touch screen interfaces only and improve flow and visual design.</description>

      <description>SEOmoz user chenry posted some i8nteresting data showing captcha&amp;rsquo;s effect on conversion rates vs. reduction in spam. Chenry was given the task of eliminating spam that was being submitted through a web form. Disliking the captcha solution, he decided run a test to compare the data after adding captcha for a period of time, with data captured after turning captcha off. He made the following observation:
From the data you can see that with CAPTCHA on, there was an 88% reduction in SPAM but there were 159 failed conversions.</description>

      <description>Well, it&#39;s been a hell of a morning. As you know, Konigi allows registered users to post to the blog, showcase, tools, and wiki sections. Up to now, all user submissions have been appropriate, but last night a registered user posted spam content to the blog. This is largely because I missed one configuration option--spam checking on blog/notebook entries.
That user has been banned/blocked, but for the time being I&#39;m adding a few measures in place to prevent this from happening again:</description>

      <description>Social Design Notes has collected a list of design manifestos from the past 100 years, largely drawn from Mario Piazza’s presentation at the Più Design Può conference in Florence. Since the days of radical printer-pamphleteers, design and designers have a long history of fighting for what’s right and working to transform society. The rise of the literary form of the manifesto also parallels the rise of modernity and the spread of letterpress printing.</description>

      <description>The Virgin.com redesign sports a header that provides a boatload of functionality using mega fly out menus: locale selection, micro-site navigation, registration, login, and newsletter signup. I like that they make these options readily available wherever you are on the site. The longer drop downs like the registration form, for example, seem a little long for users on smaller screens, e.g. netbooks. 1. The global navigation bar provides mega drop downs with sub-nodes and links to their subsidiary companies that provide products and services under each category.</description>

      <description>Dustin Curtis did an interesting experiment with a short call to action at the bottom of his pages, asking users to follow him on Twitter. Comparing the results shows that direct, but informally worded calls to action, and (ugh) using a literal call out like the word &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo; had a pretty significant impact. As the forcefulness and personal identifiability of the phrase increased, the number of clicks likewise increased. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rdquo; identifies the reader directly, &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; implies an obligation, and &amp;ldquo;follow me on twitter&amp;rdquo; is a direct command.</description>

      <description>UserTesting is a commercial service that promises automated usability testing.
You might think of this as a series of task-oriented usability test sessions where you only need enter a number of tasks for a test that will take approximately 15 minutes, enter the demographics (age, income) and technographics (computer experience) for the user you&#39;d like to target. UserTesting has a pool of paid testers who accept sessions, view your site with a floating layer that shows the tasks to complete while they record their voice, mouse clicks and movements, and page changes.</description>

      <description>Excellent use of subtle shadows and gradients in the header navigation. The faint radial gradient for the lighting effect on the centered logo is perfect, perhaps making reference to the light from a church apse shining down on an alter, which of course has symbolic meaning. It&amp;rsquo;s a very subtle thing, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s intended, but it has a powerful effect and adds a subtext to the design.</description>

Don’t forget the usability basics. Jakob Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics are as relevant now as they were in 1999. I stress this because I looked at the Flex showcase recently, and it looks like many of the applications are not built with these best practices in mind.

      <description>Jakob Nielsen recently called for an end to password masking, and a few people have come up with interesting approaches that try to find a middle ground between the typical prractice of masking passwords with asterisks. arc90 are experimenting with a half-masking technique. The method partially obscures the password by placing a few blurred characters in the background so that the characters are not easily read by someone looking over the user&amp;rsquo;s shoulder.</description>

      <description>Erin Kissane writes about using content templates &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; to help speed up the information-collection process, improve consistency across the website, and make the editing process easier and more orderly&amp;rdquo; in A List Apart.
The ideal situation is to have a content strategist, perhaps a technical writer, who can provide the guidance for auditing and organizing information, and add some rigor to the writing process. The absence of a content strategist on a project necessitates at least dedicating one person to this task.</description>

      <description>Game maker EA provides access to their network of microsites from EA.com and offers cross-site navigation via a toolbar that is positioned at the bottom or top of each site. I like the design of the navigation on the main site and the Sports sites. But the navigation is inconsistent in position, visual design, and behavior from site to site. The Pogo site doesn&#39;t have a micro-site navigator at all, so ironically, you have to &#34;</description>

      <description>Nike.com&#39;s main site provides entry to a host of micro-sites for each sport or product family, but a consistent navigation model is provided across all microsites. A primary navigation widget is provided in the Nike Swoosh button, which reveals a list of a few of the most popular microsite destinations. A &#34;More&#34; link epxands the list to show all of the microsites.

Or they&amp;rsquo;re modeled largely after blogs with articles are long and scrolling, are limited by the possibilities of HTML/CSS, and have layouts that aren&amp;rsquo;t differentiated from blogs and which pale in comparison to the layout in the printed version of the original magazine article.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the 6 part collection of minimalist designs posted by Vandelay Design. Some sites are more minimalist than others. I tend to use that term loosely at times as well. But the predominant theme seems to be type as interface, minimal use of graphics (aside from a logo and the body content), few if any graphic treatments of navigation, and little to no use of texture and graphic effects, and liberal use of white space.</description>

      <description>Joshua Porter writes about the use of microcopy to create confidence and alleviate concerns in customers about the actions they take on your site. Ironically, the smallest bits of copy, microcopy, can have the biggest impact. &amp;hellip; Microcopy is small yet powerful copy. It’s fast, light, and deadly. It’s a short sentence, a phrase, a few words. A single word. It’s the small copy that has the biggest impact. Don’t judge it on its size…judge it on its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>Think Vitamin interviews 37 Signals&amp;rsquo; Ryan Singer to talk about ui design, frontend development, project management and inspiration. I like that Singer suggests that designers read more about writing copy, but even more so, I like how he suggests that designers should also consider learning more about front end development and programming frameworks. At the very least, it allows designers to be conversant with developers, and ideally it gives a designer a new range of skills they can use for such things as prototyping or doing proof of concept work on their own.</description>

      <description>Shopping cart provider Big Cartel hosts simple, customizable ecommerce sites for independent creatives, e.g. artists and musicians. The company site sells the product by describing the service in terms of value, and by providing examples of other artist sites, and the design experience. I think the soft textured watercolor background in the header gives it a hand-crafted feel that&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to this audience. I think emphasizing the sign up link slightly might be a good idea.</description>

      <description>MTV International / Mad Drummer from Universal Everything on Vimeo.
 Awesome motion graphics by Universal Everything for MTV. Creative Review reviews the new work on MTV&amp;rsquo;s new look, which is a forward-looking transformation that reminds me feel that reminds me of Cartoon Network&amp;rsquo;s recent rebranding in the Tristan Eaton designed character videos.

      <description>Jeff Sexton got Patrick Sullivan, Jr. to list the top things not to do when conducting a usability test. The top 6 list should serve as a good reminder for the UX Designer who does the occasional user test.
1) Never ask, “What do you think about this?”
2) Don’t feed the tester with your question.
3) Don’t let users be the designers.
4) Don’t let the statistics fool you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with making magnets of some of the elements of the Wireframe Stencil to use for prototyping. Was an interesting experiment printing and cutting these. Next time I think I&amp;rsquo;ll have to laminate the sheet first, and then cut. The lamination might make it possible to write on them with dry erase marker. If you write directly on the magnet sheets the ink will stay permanently I&amp;rsquo;d think. The surface seems kind of porous and a little textured.</description>

      <description>The Gatorade site redesign accompanies the drink maker&amp;rsquo;s rebranding and the bold type of the product names on every bottle. Every drink name is an active message about excelling in sports and the video loop that runs in the background of product and athlete pages suffuses the site with the imagery of athletes kicking ass. A product filter allows users to view by product name or nutritient.

The first is Robert Fabricant&amp;rsquo;s article on &amp;ldquo;Design with Intent: how designers can influence behavior&amp;rdquo;, and the follow up is Dan Lockton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;frog design on Design with Intent&amp;rdquo;.
User centered design focuses primarily on user needs and research and decision making must support these needs.</description>

      <description>Metalab&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic evokes the crisp, metalic edges and rounded stylistic elements that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to associate with Apple. You can see it in the details of their gradients, shadows and lighting effects. The visual style is clean, but what I found most enjoyable was the combined use of vertical tabs and carousels on the home page&amp;#8212;essentially their portfolio. The message is really simple and bold too. &amp;ldquo;We make interfaces, we strive for pixel perfection.</description>

      <title>Why browser zoom shouldn&#39;t kill flexible layouts</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/why-browser-zoom-shouldnt-kill-flexible-layouts/</guid>
      <description>Zoe Mickley Gillenwater posted an interesting article which makes the argument that browser zoom doesn&amp;rsquo;t obviate the utility of flexible (liquid and elastic) layouts. The argument is apparently being made that because of browser zoom, flexible layouts aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary. But in fact, web designers that have fixed layouts know that the default zoom behavior on fixed layouts causes horizontal scrollbars. The fix is to use &amp;ldquo;Zoom text only&amp;rdquo; options, e.g. in Firefox and Safari 4.</description>

      <description>Fever is a feed reading server product. The product site features a single-page design, with well-organized and clear product information at the top, and navigation anchors that scroll the page down. All of the features you need from the service&amp;#8212;purchasing info, account info, customer support&amp;#8212;are included dynamically in the single page, so once you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased the product, for instance, your customer info is populated into the account area. Support forms are also in-page.</description>

      <description>Less Everything did a couple of A-B tests on the call to action buttons on the home page of their Less Accounting product. Their first test modified the design of 2 buttons (see tour, try), using 1 button instead for the &amp;ldquo;Try Less Accounting&amp;rdquo; link and a text link for &amp;ldquo;See Tour&amp;rdquo;. They noticed a small increase in conversion when they went to the single button, and then did a second test, reversing the position of the button and link.</description>

      <description>Palm&amp;rsquo;s Pre product page has a serious, polished look that I assume is targeted at a &amp;ldquo;grown up,&amp;rdquo; no-nonsense audience, judging by the business user scenarios in the video and the big kitchen counter backdrop. The smooth, rounded corners of the page&amp;rsquo;s UI elements echo the pebble shape of the phone and the circular shapes of the Pre OS. I like the use of depth of field with the full bleed photo, the hover of the boxes on the right, the change in state when clicking the site search box, and the categorized features at the bottom.</description>

      <description>Core77 reviews Timothy O&amp;rsquo;Donnell&amp;rsquo;s Sketchbook, which looks at the problem solving processes of influential designers on finished projects through the lens of their sketchbooks. It looks beautiful. Organized in three sections, &amp;ldquo;Rough,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Refined,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Random&amp;rdquo; (plus bonus section &amp;ldquo;Revealed,&amp;rdquo; where O&amp;rsquo;Donnell shows the thumbnail sketches he used to lay out the book), almost all sketches/sketchbook pages are pared with pictures of the finished product side by side. The &amp;ldquo;Rough&amp;rdquo; section features loose artwork and thick lines, but crisp final products, like the way Jason Munn turns simple sketches into iconic music posters, while the &amp;ldquo;Refined&amp;rdquo; section sees Stefan Bucher&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous pens turned into, well, equally iconic logos and business cards.</description>

      <description>Samantha Warren&amp;rsquo;s blog and portfolio is features some great layered graphics in the trompe l&amp;rsquo;oeil header and footer and some lovely type. I like the paper textures, the subtle shadows and little 3D effects, the nice treatment of the search box, and the general feeling of dynamism created by the asymmetry of the header/footer and layering, balanced by the strong alignment in the body. Nice stuff.

      <description>Jennifer Bove, principal at Kicker Studio, writes about the ways interaction designers can make design more about people and less about technology--designing behaviors that are defined from the point of view of humans, and designed to elicit emotion, make products and services more enjoyable and easier to use. Bove writes about the subtle things that can reference human connection, whether it is the language presented in system messages, the logic behind system behaviors that reflects human thought and desire, or subtle cues and movement that feels organic This is an excellent read that picks up the thread in Don Norman&#39;s Emotional Design, and Dave Malouf&#39;s recent writing about moving beyond function towards enjoyment.</description>

      <description>Nick Finck&amp;rsquo;s Puget Sound SIGCHI lecture on the Lifecycle of the Wireframe discusses Nick&amp;rsquo;s IA process. My overall strategy for IA is 3 step process; understanding the problem (note: not merely identifying the problem but really understanding it), find a solution (there may be more than one solution, but there is often only one right solution), and present the solution (a large part of your job as a IA is presenting your work so the client can understand the results).</description>

This wording used in an enterprise context is the example provided, &#34;Click here to view your views.&#34; Confusing and awkward. A dialogue follows with several designers, who seem to agree that understanding the language of the business and context, and using that in the given situation is the right approach. It&#39;s a matter of unearthing the terminology, whether through contextual inquiry and exercises like card sorting, and using what&#39;s appropriate and familiar in the context, so users can &#34;</description>

      <description>Ad agencies are outdoing each other in terms of clever uses of social media. BooneOakley&amp;rsquo;s new web site is actually a series of YouTube videos with links placed via annotations into the videos to connect all of what we might traditionally think of as sections. What they create is something like a network of hypertext connections to hold together a concept of site&amp;#8212;hacked together boundaries that create space within another larger space.</description>

      <description>Occasionally the argument about the affect of aesthetics or beauty on usability seems to come up in UX discussion, and this CHI short paper from 1995 is referred to. This is an article by members of the Design Center, Hitachi discusses the team&#39;s research on determinants to apparent usability, based on tests of design and psychology students. These results show that the apparent usability is less correlated with the inherent usability compared to to the apparent beauty.</description>

      <description>ClickTale makes observations about scrolling based on their research of users&amp;rsquo; browsing behaviors around &amp;ldquo;the fold.&amp;rdquo; Their report on scrolling makes the following conclusions: [I[t appears that visitors scroll in a relative way - about the same percentage of page views will reach the middle of a web page regardless of the actual page height in pixels.
Visitors appear to be using the location of the scroll bar but not the size of the tracker when scrolling, since the scroll bar location is a relative indicator and the scroll tracker size is an indicator of page height.</description>

      <description>Kickstarter is a brilliant idea for creatives needing funding for projects. It&amp;rsquo;s a funding platform for artists, designers, filmmakers, musicians, journalists, inventors, bloggers, etc. It works much like fundraising sites you may have used if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to raise money for events for non profit organizations. A few years ago I used a similar one for Team In Training.
You set up a page stating your mission and the need for funding.</description>

We’ve been working with foundries to develop a consistent web-only font linking license. We’ve built a technology platform that lets us to host both free and commercial fonts in a way that is incredibly fast, smoothes out differences in how browsers handle type, and offers the level of protection that type designers need without resorting to annoying and ineffective DRM.</description>

      <description>Definition Heuristic evaluation is a discount usability engineering method for quick, cheap, and easy evaluation of a user interface design.
Heuristic evaluation is the most popular of the usability inspection methods. Heuristic evaluation is done as a systematic inspection of a user interface design for usability. The goal of heuristic evaluation is to find the usability problems in the design so that they can be attended to as part of an iterative design process.</description>

      <description>Design Observer points to the 1999 ABC Nightline program that took an inside look at IDEO. How does the process of designing a better product work? To show you, Nightline went to Palo Alto, CA to the designers at IDEO, and gave them the toughest problem we could think of. Take something old and familiar like the shopping cart and completely redesign it in just five days.
IDEO&amp;rsquo;s unique brand of brainstorming is called &amp;ldquo;Deep Dive,&amp;rdquo; a sort of total immersion into the problem at hand.</description>

      <description>About User Experience Design in the Agile Software Development method and Agile Process.
Agile Method Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.
Agile methods generally promote a project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices that allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals.</description>

      <description>Goal Directed Design is an interaction design methodology created by Cooper that identifies the goals and behaviors of users, and the goals of a business, and directly translates these into design.
The process is broken down into the following steps, according to the process page on the Cooper site.
 Project Planning  Research  Modeling  Requirements  Framework  Refinement  Support  A more detailed description of the tasks associated with this process are described in &amp;quot;Goal-Directed Design: An Interview with Kim Goodwin,&amp;quot; by Christine Perfetti on the User Interface Engineering site.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/articles/iterative-process/</guid>
      <description>Method Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability testing is the measurement of the usability of a product or service. The definition from usability.gov succinctly describes the process.
In a usability test, representative users try to do typical tasks with the product, while observers, including the development staff, watch, listen, and take notes. The product can be a Web site, Web application, or any other product. It does not have to be a finished product. You should be testing prototypes from early paper-based stages through fully functional later stages.</description>

We create concept maps, a type of model, to explore and learn about complex information spaces. By showing everything—the forest and the trees—in a single view, concept maps help people create mental models and clarify thoughts. We create concept maps to share understanding—with our clients, peers, and others interested in the subjects.

As he says, the form itself is the least of your concerns. Porter describes the entire experience leading up to the call to action, providing excellent examples that ease users into sign up.</description>

      <description>The Yahoo! UI Library&amp;rsquo;s Grids CSS framework might seem hard to grok at first, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for the past year on a commercial project and find that it&amp;rsquo;s solid for liquid CSS layouts. The grid builder helps to visualize what&amp;rsquo;s possible and view the rather obscure naming conventions they use in CSS classes.
The framework offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns.</description>

      <description>Anthony Viviano at Organic asks if Information Architecture is dead, continuing the discussions about the inclusiveness and expanding scope of IA vis-a-vis UX, and hopping on the question about interaction design being a dead end job. Clearly, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t think the practice and craft of IA is dead, just as the craft of Interaction Design is clearly alive. But the role is changing, and while the navel gazing gets resoundingly loud around defining things, the definition of the shifting roles and responsibilities in the field is meaningful.</description>

Rather than sketch the whole page on a sheet of paper, I prefer to draw out the various components of the page, cut them out, and Blu-Tack them to the paper. This makes it easy to change different elements, switch them around, etc, without having to redraw the whole page each time.</description>

      <description>FlairBuilder is a cross-platform tool for rapid authoring of interactive wireframes and software prototypes. It focuses purely on wireframing/prototyping, and provides an experience that looks like it&#39;s targeted at apps like Axure, but work will cross-platform because it&#39;s built on Adobe AIR.
 The application provides a page/canvas editor onto which you may drag and drop UI components. Selecting a component provides a properties inspector so that may set dimensions and stylistic properties, text values, and any other available UI options.</description>

      <description>The NYTimes interviewed Doug Bowman to talk about his departure from Google, which Bowman wrote about on his blog in March. Bowman came onto Google as their first Visual Designer 3 years ago, and left in March. Some quotes from the article:
Bowman on Google:
“Data eventually becomes a crutch for every decision, paralyzing the company and preventing it from making any daring design decisions,”
 Bowman on Twitter, where he is now Creative Director:</description>

      <description>On Made By Many, Isaac Pinnock looks back at his 10 year history using wireframes and their evolution in IA practice from time consuming deliverable in functional specifications, to disposable artifacts of the design process. The notion that highly visual wireframes should be part of the design process resonates with me. http://www.madebymany.co.uk/the-future-of-wireframes-00991</description>

      <description>Jason Santa Maria started a sketchbook group on flickr. Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist, they’re about being a good thinker. In the spirit of awareness, I’ve set up a Flickr group for this very purpose. Post one, and only one, spread/page from your sketchbook. It’s always fun to see how everyone else’s mind works.

      <description>This selection of screens showcases the different social networking and video sites that the Whitehouse has set up. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how much continuity and consistency they&amp;rsquo;re able to achieve given the design constraints imposed by the sites. Perhaps they&amp;rsquo;re given the unique layout options Networks get on YouTube channels. But they couldn&amp;rsquo;t do much with the Facebook page. The MySpace implementation is particularly impressive as an example of site skinning.</description>

      <description>In the Cooper Journal, Tim McCoy responds to Bill Moggridge&#39;s comment after a screening of Objectified. He paraphrases Moggridge as saying interaction design has become pervasive, that anyone and everyone can be an interaction designer, and so the role of professional interaction designer is (or is becoming) unnecessary.
McCoy asks if interaction design is really dead. He goes on to point out a few factors that have allowed developers to build better interfaces without interaction designers.</description>

      <description>Definitions the original or model on which something is based or formed.
Source: Dictionary.com
[O]n an individual basis our definitions and descriptions of what constitutes a “prototype” vary greatly. Prototypes have been described as hi-fidelity, lo-fidelity, functional, nonfunctional, paper, Flash®, HTML, interactive, non-interactive, click-through, garden variety walk-through, cognitive walk-through—the list just keeps going.
...
When I refer to a prototype, I&#39;m referring to something that, from my book, &amp;quot;regardless of its fidelity, functionality, or how it’s made, a prototype is a conceptual model that captures and communicates the vision, intent, or idea of a design.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/12-excellent-examples-lazy-registration/</guid>
      <description>This is a short entry about sites that use &amp;ldquo;Lazy Registration,&amp;rdquo; or registration/sign up processes that often don&amp;rsquo;t require any information from the user while they try out a site, until they decide to commit to using it. In some cases, sites bypass signup altogether, and in others, users are permitted to register once they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go beyond simply &amp;ldquo;testing out&amp;rdquo; a site or application. As noted, the process of &amp;ldquo;getting your feet wet by trying,&amp;rdquo; most likely leads to more sign ups because of the frictionless experience.</description>

      <description>Stephanie Lemieux discusses issues to consider when designing faceted navigation interfaces for search in the latest UIE newsletter.
Faceted search is a very popular and powerful solution when done well; it allows users to deconstruct a large set of results into bite-size pieces and navigate based on what’s important to them. But faceted search by itself is not necessarily going to make your users lives easier. You need to understand your users’ mental models (how they seek information), test your assumptions about how they will interpret your terms and categories and spend time refining your approach.</description>

      <description>I spoke with Russ Perry at the Phoenix Ad Blog to discuss what User Experience Design might mean to graphic designers and marketing professionals, especially those not involved in the design of sites and apps. I don&amp;rsquo;t like getting caught up in the &amp;ldquo;defining the damned thing&amp;rdquo; discussions, but there you have it. Oh, and I mention Zappos, not because of their visual or interface design, per se, but about their relevance in terms of the holistic approach to user experience outside of the interface.</description>

      <description>There are quite a few nice takeaways from Stephen P. Anderson&amp;rsquo;s article in A List Apart, a discussion in defense of the value of visual design beyond more than just aesthetic skinning of functionality. I like this one where he flips the notion that things are enjoyable because of how they function by saying:
[T]hings that are enjoyable will be easy to use and efficient.&amp;rdquo;
 This is connected with the user&amp;rsquo;s belief that attention to design detail is related to quality.</description>

      <description>Profoto&#39;s take on the breadcrumb combines expanded menus for each branch to provide a drill-down method for navigating siblings, aunts, great-aunts, etc. It basically exposes the hierarchy of siblings at each level, and it&#39;s really most useful when you&#39;ve navigated deep into a hierarchy.

      <description>Simple single page product site for LittleSnapper iPhone, an app that lets you snap, tag, and share photos. I love the how the screenshots and videos slide into the iphone image on the page when you click the buttons on the right. Brilliant idea.

      <description>David Malouf believes that &#34;most successful products create a sense of connectedness between the consumer and the designer and that this connection occurs when designers balance the pull towards the rational, functional, &amp;amp; expedient with the natural &amp;amp; emotional.&#34;
In his article on Johnny Holland, David looks more deeply at what it means for an end-user to be connected to a product. He first looks at how art creates connection with humanity.</description>

      <description>Definition A method of low cost usability engineering proposed by Jakob Nielsen that asserts that usability that is performed frequently with fewer participants, and using scenario based observation yields results that are nearly as good, and with better ROI when compared with costlier traditional usability testing.
Ergosoft Laboratories summarizes the method:
The primary characteristics of discount usability engineering are small sample sizes (i.e., fewer participants), frequent iterations of these small tests, and reliance on direct observations rather than on statistically established findings.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability is an approach to product development that incorporates direct user feedback throughout the development cycle in order to reduce costs and create products and tools that meet user needs. There are many definitions of usability from books by usability professionals.
Two international standards define usability and human-centered (or user-centered) design:
&amp;quot;[Usability refers to] the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-tip-change-keyboard-shortcuts/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip that I blurted out on Twitter in a moment of frustration. I use both Adobe Illustrator and OmniGraffle, and one thing that repeatedly trips me up is using the keyboard shortcuts for grouping/ungrouping between the two apps. Illustrator uses Cmd-G to group, and OmniGraffle uses Shift-Cmd-G. They add the Shift key because CMD-G is assigned to search again which I don&amp;rsquo;t use all that often.
The fix for this, as well as for any Mac application is simple.</description>

      <description>Khoi Vinh wrote an entry on taking the need for criticism inside the studio, and extending that openness in engaging in critical dialogue to discussion with peers outside of your working groups.
Like it or not, you can’t have a serious discourse about an art form until you have people whose sole involvement in that art form is criticism. You need, in effect, an independent press. Actually, to be clear, what you need is an economic model that can support a corps of passionate, clear-thinking individuals who are dedicated to vigilantly watching over the progression of the medium.</description>

      <title>Hunkering: Putting Disorientation into the Design Process</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/hunkering-putting-disorientation-design-process/</guid>
      <description>Jared Spool talks about &#34;visual disorientation,&#34; a designer&#39;s technique for evaluating your design work in the middle of a process. It&#39;s certainly common to see designer&#39;s tack up pieces of paper around their project space, e.g. schematics, pictures with references to other objects that provide inspiration, etc. Hunkering, however, is more of a technique to create disorientation and change in one&#39;s perspective momentarily, to assess what you&#39;ve done. Visual disorientation is a fast way to identify the places where things don&#39;t quite match up.</description>

      <description>UX Hero points out a technique that you may not be using, but should consider. Stepping back and squinting to evaluate your work is something I was told to do repeatedly when I was first learning to paint, and is something I still do today as an interface designer. It helps you see the whole of your screen and look for anything that stands out, and see what needs to draw more attention, depending on the priority and hierarchy of your page elements.</description>

      <description>Twiddla is an easy to use collaborative whiteboard service, but it&amp;rsquo;s really got the potential to be much more. The whiteboard lets you mark up websites and graphics, and even use a drag-drop library of interface elements for working on interface concepts collaboratively. You communicate with others in the meeting with the chat window, and you can also use built in audio-conferencing capabilities. Very impressive, and free. Would make sense for there to be options for private meetings as well as embedding the whiteboard into your CMS or intranet.</description>

I&#39;ve also started including a barebones option without elastic, inner pocket, or pencil. The standard option is $16 and the barebones option is $2 less. The standard option is hand-crafted by me here in Brooklyn, so they&#39;ll sell out faster than the barebones options.</description>

From the IAWiki:
 Patterns are optimal solutions to common problems. As common problems are tossed around a community and are resolved, common solutions often spontaneously emerge. Eventually, the best of these rise above the din and self-identify and become refined until they reach the status of a Design Pattern.  Each pattern has four primary components:</description>

      <description>John M. Carroll discusses the history of Human Computer Interaction on Interaction-Design.org.
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer science. HCI has expanded rapidly and steadily for three decades, attracting professionals from many other disciplines and incorporating diverse concepts and approaches. To a considerable extent, HCI now aggregates a collection of semi-distinct fields of research and practice in human-centered informatics.</description>

      <description>Justinmind Prototyper is a tool to design wireframes and run simulations for web, desktop and mobile applications. The product looks similar to Axure, and lets you define user interface elements using a drag and drop environment with component libraries, and attach actions to components. The prototypes allow you to map interactive behaviors to elements, define process logic and flow, and add functional specifications and annotations. Looks very full featured and offers the possibility of running a web server to deploy multiple prototypes that are viewable in a browser and allow users to comment on designs.</description>

      <description>When a software company&#39;s product family grows, it can be quite difficult for customers to figure out which product is right for their needs. Quicken is one of those examples where the number of products is overwhelming. They try to help customers with a product comparison table provides a basic checkbox chart of all product feature categories, with product names and prices along the top of the table, and rows of feature categories, with checkboxes to indicate which products match which features.</description>

      <description>Twitter provides a subtle, unobtrusive notification messages, e.g. when a direct message is sent. The confirmation appears as a layer with a white background over the top of the page, covering the page header, and unfortunately, not providing a more obvious &#34;Close&#34; link to dismiss the message. The message can be easily dismissed by clicking anywhere in the div, but that&#39;s not readily apparent.

      <description>iPhone Mockup looks like a cool proof of concept for a sketchy mockup app for iPhone. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like Balsamiq in spirit, but is done completely with JQuery. Firefox and Safari are the target browsers, and there is no option for doing secure mockups. Whatever you do will be visible to the world, so don&amp;rsquo;t plan on using it for anything other than playing. Nice concept though. Thanks, Andrew.</description>

The user simply enters the recipients address and presses send. An AJAX progress spinner appears briefly, then a confirmation message, and the form collapses back to the icon.</description>

      <description>This is an interesting idea in principle. Feng-GUI helps you find out how people see your website, photo or ad and which areas are getting most of the attention. Feng-GUI simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals,
and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.
This offers designers, advertisers and creatives, a Pre-testing technology that predicts performance of an image, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the Flow of Attention.</description>

The treatment of the slash motif morphing into the trapezoids repeated throughout the site in the photography is cool.

After years of making documents that look like they are FEBE (for engineers, by engineers), we’re seeing increasing evidence of the human hand in our own work. Why are sketches and drawing suddenly so prevalent? Well, for one, they can save a lot of time and mitigate the risk of building the wrong thing.</description>

Marcotte describes that the technique of calculating percentages for column widths is the same method we use for calculating font sizes in ems. To calculate fluid grid dimensions, we first take a base font size of 100%, which is usually 16px in the majority of browsers when not altered by the user.</description>

      <description>We covered Shelfari&#39;s hybrid button in their list views of bookshelf items. That example showed a single push button with an attached icon for drop down menu. The single button allowed for the use of a default behavior, while the drop down arrow allowed for the display of other options for the item. The drop down menu allowed users to make multiple selections, i.e. using checkbox behaviors, rather than just select one value in the drop down list.</description>

      <description>Netflix offers an undo function in their Queue that allows users to undo a remove action. Users click an X icon to remove a movie from their queue, and the row is grayed out, showing an undo text link replacing the remove icon. The row persists until the user moves to a different page, so several removed rows may be visible if the user does repeated removes in one session. Upon return visits to the queue, the removed movies will be gone.</description>

      <description>On the Tea with Teresa podcast, Teresa Brazen interviews Adaptive Path&amp;rsquo;s Peter Merholz to talk about the history and evolution of User Experience Design. User experience design is, at its core, a philosophy that products and services should be designed so that they are pleasurable and easy for people to use. While that might seem an obvious design approach, it&amp;rsquo;s actually not the way many designers historically thought about making things.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re a clothing and accessories company that aims at providing products with materials and construction that are meant to last and can be handed down to others for reuse. What I like most is how they use storytelling to provide a picture about materials in their products and their handmedown idea, which is communicated in its own mini site.</description>

      <description>Victor writes about some of the less obvious points when it comes to presenting and communicating concept designs.
When I see concepts that are received well, the concept itself can usually only take a portion of the credit. Just as important is how the concept is communicated. Some of this is common knowledge: make it look good, choose the right level of fidelity, show it in context. Others are maybe not so obvious…</description>

It can be confusing to understand the role of the IA, because in many cases, IA encompasses more than what is defined in this primer.</description>

Guess 18-30-ish guys are their target demographic. Clever use of interactive video and a humorous story to keep you engaged on the site for more than a few seconds.</description>

      <description>Music community site thesixtyone uses unobtrusive growl-like panels in the bottom right corner of the page for system alerts and messaging. Like growl or iminlikewithyou, these messages appear briefly and fade out. The effect is subtle and might be easily missed, but the addition of an ambient &#34;pop&#34; earcon (alert sound) tells you to look for the message. Nicely done.

      <description>Theresa Neil is writing a 6 part series of articles on designing great Adobe Flex/Air user experiences. The first 3 parts are up now.
After designing several large enterprise applications for diverse clients and industries, I’ve noticed some barriers to crafting a great experience in Flex. I think these barriers arise from the relative newness of the technology (and RIAs in general), the initial focus on development over design, and the confidence that Flex can provide a great UX out of the box.</description>

      <description>So it&#39;s my birthday today. One thing that I&#39;ve learned about birthdays from having a child, is that it&#39;s a lot of fun to give gifts away on your birthday. I&#39;m now a seasoned goodie bag shopper and can tell you some interesting places to go in Manhattan and Brooklyn to find unusual gifts for boys age 8-10. But since I can&#39;t give all of you rare swag from Tokyo Toy, I thought I&#39;d offer up a template that freelancers might find useful.</description>

      <description>The Scott Swigart and Sean Campbell interview Liz Danico to discuss user experience on the How Software is Built blog. The lengthy conversation covers a wide array of topics including Liz&#39;s view of the differences in design process between typical clients with small teams and larger open source projects with communities of participants, design vision and leadership in open source software, and opinions about the acceptance with the direction that open source software has led users in terms of sharing data.</description>

      <description>The recent Skittles launch, which appropriated Modernista&#39;s idea, and the Shepard Fairey law suit, which questions whether or not the artist has a first ammendment right to use images appropriated from an AP photohjournalist, is making me think more and more about the issue of plagiarism vs. inspiration. I don&#39;t know who was involved with the making of the Skittles site, but it reminds me of how BBDO ripped off Spike Jonze&#39;s &#34;</description>

      <description>Stealing a page out of Modernista&amp;rsquo;s book, Skittles launches a site that uses social networking and media sites as its backdrop. Like the Modernista site, the effect is unexpected and attention getting. Choosing Twitter for this experiment was pretty gutsy. Whereas they could have more control over what goes on their YouTube and Facebook pages, the sentiment on Twitter isn&amp;rsquo;t all too positive. You can check the live feed of Skittles tweets at Newstrendz, a new social trends site.</description>

      <description>uxRefresh has collected a handful of examples of A-Z indexes of titles on large sites. Also useful might be a look at the article I wrote about KWIC/KWOC/A-Z Site Indexes work I did while at Bell Labs, and for a deeper dive, look at the list of links of indexer-designed examples on the Montague Institute&amp;rsquo;s site. Many of the latter are still valid, but there&amp;rsquo;s some link rot there too. James Kalbach also recently wrote on A-Z indexes, and in particular demonstrated the use of indexes in search auto-completion using Elsevier bibliographic database EMBASE.</description>

      <description>The Drawing Board: Commuter Buddy from Cooper Journal on Vimeo. Cooper Interactive&amp;rsquo;s Commuter Buddy concept video is another great find via Dave Malouf&amp;rsquo;s Engage blog. You might have already seen this one, but as Dave points out, it is a great example of using personas, narrative, and really low fidelity sketches to demonstrate a concept.
The video above uses still photography, super-imposed photos of whiteboard drawings, and voice over narrative to describe the idea for a mobile phone application that helps a commuter to get to his ride on time, and even to remember to get off if he becomes engrossed in an article, for instance.</description>

Luckily Drupal&#39;s logintoboggan module allows admins to offer this option, as well as offering registration and signup without the roundtrip to email. Sweet. Thanks for making my life easier, Drupal.
This should help ease the experience of finding your file downloads as well if you bought stencils or icons form the store. It also brings me around to re-implementing some of the features I put in in Feb-March last year and then took out, e.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve made some 8.5 in. by 5.25 in. graph paper notebooks because I wanted something a little more functional than what I was using for sketching. They&amp;rsquo;re basically a mini version of the wireframe grid I use, with markers for 1/3s and 1/4s, but without the gutters. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a prototype of this for a few months now and have a bunch of these ready to put up for sale, but haven&amp;rsquo;t been rushing to do it, mostly because I made them for myself and selling stuff like notebooks isn&amp;rsquo;t profitable until you get into selling large quantities, and unfortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t the time to market the pads and books.</description>

      <description>Huffduffer, a hybrid bookmarking/podcast service features a whimsical inline registration form that&#39;s formatted in sentences with blank areas that the user fills out with their name, password, etc. Kind of a fun, unexpected way to format the form. Reminds me of the kinds of forms you&#39;d fill out by hand in days of old, which goes with the retro style of the site.

      <description>Print Magazine interviews Milton Glaser to discuss Shepard Fairey and the topic of appropriation and plagiarism. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, Fairey is the graffiti artist responsible for such iconic imagery as the ubiquitous Andre OBEY tag and the Obama Hope image. Glaser had this to say, on the topic of copying other artists&amp;rsquo; work:
The process of looking back at the past is very accepted in our business—the difference is when you take something without adding anything to the conversation.</description>

      <description>Prezi is an interesting web app that allows users to create Flash-based Zoomable/Pannable presentations. The interface brings up a presentation editor with a keyboard command, and displays a radial menu for placing media objects, drawing paths for prev/next animation, etc. The finished presentation allows users to step through the &amp;ldquo;slides&amp;rdquo; as the canvas zooms and pans. It really might be a nice service for doing things like simple product screencasts, for instance, and hopefully the finished product will allow you to export your work for embedding on your site.</description>

In this case a student describes the change of context in a sketch presentation by using the word &#34;</description>

Among my favorite points are those about ownership and involvement. This is to do with ensuring that someone is driving the process and iterations, and making sure that the interaction design process doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, but is reviewed, validated, and informed by key team members, e.</description>

      <description>In BusinessWeek, Bill Buxton discusses how to keep innovating, with the main idea being that you can continue to cultivate creativity and innovation by finding new things that you have a passion for. He suggests that when you get good enough at a thing, you should find something else to be passionate about, and commit and throw yourself into learning how to do it. You&#39;ll be bad at it at first, but the experience of learning something new, no matter how bad you are at it at first, may affect your creativity in positive ways that you won&#39;t realize until you experience it.</description>

      <description>The New York Times&amp;rsquo; Article Skimmer prototype provides a nice gallery view of top articles, and utilizes a categories sidebar to filter articles. Keyboard shortcuts are also provided to navigate prev/next category, or to jump to a specific category. Very nice way to view articles. The dense tabloid style of the regular site can be overwhelming sometimes. Via SwissMiss

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following this blog, you may know how I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do sketch/jitter line styles in OmniGraffle to produce sketchy diagrams and wireframes. After David&amp;rsquo;s demo of his method for doing sketch shapes on the Design Commission blog got me started figuring out how to get the effect natively in OG, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to finally create sketch versions of the Wireframe Stencils. Above is a screenshot of the forms set.</description>

      <description>Anthony Short produced a video demonstration of CSScaffold, a CSS framework takes the structural principles and architecture of current grid systems like Blueprint and the generation engine of Shaun Inman&amp;rsquo;s CSS Cacheer, and creates a CSS Grid System Builder that lets you define the rules for your layouts using meaningfully named CSS ids and classes, and automatically generates the grid system to those rules. It&amp;rsquo;s a framework that lets you focus on fitting the CSS to your design, rather than the reverse, and gives you the ability to focus on meaningful abstractions and naming rather than structural ones, so you can easily make changes in the future.</description>

      <description>Requested Reading Recommendations from the School of Visual Arts, MFA in Interaction Design program.
Upon the request of readers, we asked faculty to recommend books for an interaction design reading list. These could be landmark texts, underdogs, or critical reads, or stepping stones to other fields. The following is what resulted from our request, comprising in part: a sneak preview of what will be assigned in courses; what some consider to be cornerstone interaction design texts; and what some consider important connections to other fields.</description>

The service, nicknamed Infomaki (info roll?), combines the type of service 5 second test provides, as well as allowing single question surveys for checking on things like simple labeling issues, which you might have tested using card sorting.</description>

      <description>I love what tiny gigantic has written in this great short post about designing by writing (or the non-iterative design process). I agree wholeheartedly, although I think of writing as part of design to be accretive and/or iterative. A few choice bits from the entry:
[W]hen someone asks you why you used green, or why you included that crumpled-paper background, or why there’s a bird in the logo, you’re gonna need to know.</description>

      <description>Google modified the labeling (tagging) menus in Gmail to add a Move option to co-exist with the prior Label drop down menu. The Move menu allows the user to move an email to a single label and then archives it, removing it from the Inbox. The Label menu allows the user to add multiple labels to the email, but does not archive it. Both menus offer a label search input with auto-completion, as well as options to create new or manage existing labels.</description>

      <description>Joshua Porter&#39;s post about whether good design can be replicated is fabulous. What I like is the idea that there isn&#39;t a solid set of methods that you can reuse in every case and think it might guarantee success or &#34;good design&#34;. There&#39;s an interesting thought in there about process:
I wonder if the real issue is that most of the time designers simply don’t know if what they’re building is great, and they end up relying on process to get as far as they can.</description>

The lengthy article discusses the process of designing Creatica Inspire and includes links to HTML mockups for the new site, and for illustration purposes shows the evolution of PSDtuts, which will also come in line with the new Creatica family of sites. Great read for anyone considering redesigning an existing site with an established set of users, especially with regard to improving funcitonalities, IXD and IA, without upsetting users.</description>

      <description>Interesting discussion in M. Jackson Wilkinson&amp;rsquo;s blog about the altnernatives to hierarchical sitemaps, and the use of concept maps or user flows as alternatives when hierarchy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in your documentation. I have to agree with one point, in that site maps don&amp;rsquo;t always serve documentation well when the notion of a strict hierarchy just doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s utility in sitemaps at conveying the organization of a site or application at some level.</description>

When you set up a new test on the service, you&amp;rsquo;re given JavaScript to enter into your site template. Userfly captures sessions including link clicks and time spent on the page, and records screen events including mouse movement and keystrokes. This looks like a pretty nice service for certain types of observation. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any options for interacting with users, e.</description>

      <description>The Nike Football site uses a deceptively simple trick to draw attention to its unobtrusive search box. The narrow sidebar navigation menu features what looks like a search box that is a bit too small to be usable. Clicking what you think is the search box expands a real search input adjacent to the sidebar in the body.
It&#39;s a clever method, but as you can see from the comments, it&#39;s not without problems.</description>

When the user hovers over a button of a book that&#39;s not in your shelf, the label changes to &#34;Add to I&#39;ve Read&#34;. Clicking the drop down arrow shows other options for the book with shelf actions in the top half (I plan to read, I&#39;m reading now, I&#39;ve read), and the bottom half shows other attributes of your book (Favorite, I own, Wish list).</description>

Mousing over the first slide in the stack expands the stack to show the headings for the other nodes of content within it, and the user may now hover over the other items to view their descriptions.</description>

I knew how to do this in Visio, and had read that CAD users have something called a &amp;ldquo;Jitter&amp;rdquo; line style, so I quietly campaigned for this feature.</description>

      <description>The iTunes Store has 3 different pagination controls it uses in different places. The most common method for paging through a series of items is to show a carousel on the main pages, with prev/next arrow icons to shuffle through sets of 3-4. On special featured modules with larger poster image thumbnails they use coverflow with their hybrid scrollbar which has arrows that increment one item at a time, or allow you to scroll to move through larger increments.</description>

      <description>JazzMutant creates the Lemur and Dexter, multi-touch hardware controllers for audio production, live music and media performance. What I like about this is that it shows how much closer multi-touch brings devices to the experience of using analogous hardware controls like knobs, buttons, and sliders without any physical limitations. I once blog bitched about the fact that the Traktor DJ software I played for a few years limited the fun, and the ability to mix with two hands because at the time you could only use one input device, the mouse, to control the mixer.</description>

      <description>The Printed Blog is an interesting project that aims at publishing a newspaper of weblogs and user generated content. I like the idea of using this as a PDF rather than as a printed newspaper, since I no longer read printed newspapers. I also like the newspaper format, and have been using Tabbloid to peruse my must read daily feeds rather than using my RSS reader lately. I wonder, however, about taking online media and making analog versions of it.</description>

      <description>This is a bad-ass looking weblog with a very cool header. Big type and ample white space sets up a very clear visual hierarchy and makes it easy to read, and a strong center alignment of header/footer elements directs the eye. I love the big illustrated robot head in the header (kind of expecting it to wink at me) and the character photos in the footer. I also like the way the global navigation shifts so that the center link is whatever section you&amp;rsquo;re viewing, which makes that centered look and directs your eyes downwards.</description>

      <description>Peter Morville and Jeffrey Callender have been compiling a list of UX deliverables and have summarized 20 of them succintly on the Semantic Studios site.
This list describes twenty user experience deliverables with links to relevant resources and examples. Clearly, these artifacts of the process are not the whole story. We must also think about the relationship between goals, methods, and documents. And yet, for many of us, deliverables are the coin of the realm and merit special attention.</description>

      <description>I like the trompe l&amp;rsquo;oeil look of this paper product designer&amp;rsquo;s portfolio, designed by Deluge Studios. It&amp;rsquo;s like sneaking in and taking a snapshot of the sumptuous printed goodies on her desk while she&amp;rsquo;s not looking. The multi-column text blocks on the notepad are nice (click the About page to see that), the colors are rich and elegant, and the decorative flourishes are lovely.

Compared to the vibrant, youthful, and energentic feel of the Obama electoral campaign with it&amp;rsquo;s bolder and more saturated blues and reds, and dimensional and atmospheric graphics, this site is restrained and has an appropriate seriousness that reflects the job ahead. But it is also elegant and fresh, and has the feeling of being modern, yet stately.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing decorative from meaningful elements in UI design</title>

      <description>Ryan Singer posted a article on 37 Signals, deconstructing the design of the global navigation header on Github. In his example he points out the problem with the &amp;ldquo;Repositories: All | Search&amp;rdquo; links in the account box in the upper right of the screen, which suggests that those links are scoped to the user shown in the box. This a great example of how visual grouping and proximity could be more effectively utilized to help users make sense of the available controls.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s Quick Search Box is a QuickSilver-like launcher that lets you search your computer for applications and data, as well as search the web, and your Google Apps accounts. I presume this will also eventually replace the search interface provided by Google Desktop. The project is in beta and is provided via the Labs.
From their blog:
One of our goals at Google is to make your search experience as fluid as possible.</description>

      <description>TypeNeue is a typography blog that uses Suprb&amp;rsquo;s Grid A Liciouis theme for WordPress to give it that dense multi-column layout. Entries are ordered reverse chronologically, but unlike typical columnar layouts, the entries are read from left to right first, then top to bottom, so the lines of demarcation are staggered. This creates a unexpectedness and less ordered feeling to the layout, but gives the design the ability to put more content into the screen above the fold.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia Roll, a Flash-based Wikipedia browsing application attempts to help provide better exploration of Wikipedia entries by doing some content/link analysis and clustering topics and sub-topics related to the retrieved entry. The screen above shows the entry for &#34;interaction design.&#34; You can see that the links occurring in the article, and presumably, other related topics are grouped into clusters that can be further explored. Each cluster provides a wheel tool for spinning through the group&#39;s available terms.</description>

      <description>Whitney Hess asked some of the most influential and widely respected practitioners in UX what they consider to be the biggest misperceptions of what we do. The result is not only a terrific list that debunks myths, but an excellent compilation of quotes that better describe what UX is about than a clinical definition can. Those who were quoted described UX as many things, from the reach and touch of customers with products and companies, to the processes we use and the roles we play when we take part in its design.</description>

It does this all in one page, without the fuss of transitions to view them&amp;ndash;just scroll. There are only 2 other pages of significance here. A support page that provides search and a listing of recent support issues via Google Groups, and the shopping cart page.</description>

      <description>Tog&#39;s comparison and analysis of the human computer interaction versus the user experience with both the Amazon Kindle and the iPhone/iPod Touch is excellent. The separation of HCI/UX in his analysis really drives the point home that good interaction and industrial design can make the experience, and a good experience isn&#39;t only about the design.
I don&#39;t use a Kindle daily, so I can&#39;t comment personally on it, but the industrial design was a showstopper for me and kept me from wanting it.</description>

      <description>Pagination is often overlooked as a minor detail. Good pagination gives the user a sense of how many pages of content, e.g. search results or gallery pages, are available to view and makes it obvious how to navigate those pages. It indicates the current page, provides link targets to advance or go backward, provides a shortcuts to jump to the start of the list, and indicates how many pages are left in the list, and possibly how many items are found in the pages.</description>

      <description>Faruk Ateş provides some suggestions for implementing pagination, all of which I would agree with. After the suggestion list, Ateş shows quite a few examples and discusses what&#39;s good and bad about them. There&#39;s a huge list of examples on Smashing Magazine as well, although some of them are a little fussy.
Oddly enough, while a few of the examples show the method of using an ellipsis plus the last few page numbers as a way to show number of pages, Ateş doesn&#39;t count that as a recommended practice.</description>

      <description>Will Evans discusses how he uses wireframes in his design process. The story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before. It&amp;rsquo;s a description of concept design, using wireframes as the tool for finding the right design. One could use sketching just as well. He&amp;rsquo;s talking about that path we take as designers to frame the problem for discussion, extrapolate solutions from that discussion, and generate possible solution concepts. He calls his process one of divergence, transformation, and covergence.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve always found a chore, being a producer of graphic documents, is versioning and organizing the docs for a team. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use different tools like Source Safe, Sharepoint, Basecamp, and just shared drives to this. One nice thing I like about working with our Traction server is that it does Webdav for document management and file versioning. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preview release of to make the web-based interface a bit more friendly.</description>

      <title>Raphael JavaScript Library for Vector Graphics</title>

      <description>Henrik pointed me to Raphaël, a nice JS library for generating interactive charts.
Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. In case you want to create your own specific chart or image crop-n-rotate widget, you can simply achieve it with this library.
Raphaël uses SVG and VML as a base for graphics creation. Because of that every created object is a DOM object so you can attach JavaScript event handlers or modify objects later.</description>

      <title>typeface.js: Rendering text with Javascript, canvas, and VML</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/typefacejs-rendering-text-javascript-canvas-and-vml/</guid>
      <description>I just came across typeface.js, a type face replacement method like SIFR and FLIR, that lets you embed custom fonts in your pages using CSS. On the backend, javscript is used with  or VML to draw the glyphs for your fonts. Compared with SIFR, this suffers from some issues. Biggest one perhaps is that you can&amp;rsquo;t select text since it&amp;rsquo;s rendered as an image. Not so with SIFR. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go using this method for body text, but if you&amp;rsquo;re already considering doing image replacement for elements like headings, this would be a library to watch.</description>

      <description>It seems it&amp;rsquo;s time to start spilling out some of the meta-discussion in my head&amp;ndash;the monologue I guess&amp;ndash;about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here on Konigi. So I started to post announcements and thoughts about what I&amp;rsquo;m working on with a Konigi Twitter account.
Basically, I feel like I want to separate Konigi-specific postings from my regular Twitter stream so I can update interested readers via that account, as well as post more work in progress commentary, observations, and announcements related strictly to Konigi.</description>

Luke writes that the plugin &amp;ldquo;integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for &amp;ldquo;fail-safing&amp;rdquo; that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:
Poka-yoke (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means &amp;ldquo;fail-safing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Foolproof&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;mistake-proofing&amp;rdquo; — avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation.</description>

But I&amp;rsquo;m also finding that the netbook, a Lenovo Ideapad S10, is really pretty damned sweet for when I want to head out somewhere and do sketches in a cafe. I use it to post to our Traction server while I&amp;rsquo;m sketching.</description>

      <description>Evernote, the unique note keeping desktop, mobile, and web-based application allows users to upload notes from images or PDFs or create them right in the software as one would any publishing system. The note creation editor features a simple rich text editor with one feature that is uncommon for web-based editors--a task checkbox. All this does is insert a checkbox wherever the insertion mark (cursor) is located, and while in edit mode, allows you the user to toggle between checked (done) and unchecked (to do).</description>

      <description>Mocklinkr is another new design mockup review service to hit the web. This one adds a little twist, however, that might be pretty useful. After you upload images of your designs or wireframes, Mocklinkr let&amp;rsquo;s you create clickable sections on the image linking to another image. This let&amp;rsquo;s you do very simple click-through prototypes to change state and navigate between pages. In a way, this seems a bit like the Berkeley GUIR Denim tool, which is sadly no longer available at the GUIR site.</description>

The service also provides social features around the content. One of the nicest things about the reader is the usable pagination. The reader features the typical next/previous and jump to page features you&#39;d find in an ebook or PDF reader. They also provide some features that are similar to the browsing experience with Preview, the Dock, and QuickLook in the Mac, utilizing miniature thumbnails of pages to scroll through pages.</description>

James, the team leader had just read Bill Buxton&amp;rsquo;s Sketching the User Experience and wanted to try to get his engineers to rally around the idea that everyone can participate in this ideation phase, and no one needed any specific skill to propose and sketch ideas.</description>

When a vote is applied, the user&#39;s vote is registered, a message appears, and the voting controls are hidden. To the right, there&#39;s an exclamation mark to flag inappropriate comments, which are then immediately collapsed from view.

      <description>WordPress added some excellent layout customization options on administration screens in version 2.7. The most obvious change comes in the form of the Screen Options tab, which expands a settings panel that let&#39;s the admin hide or show parts of the UI being viewed, and saves those settings for the user immediately. The UI also provides a drag and drop behavior to re-arrange modules. When hovering over a module heading, the icon turns into a full hand and lets the user move modules up or down in the column, or between columns.</description>

      <description>Peter Flynn gives a demo of wireframing in Adobe Flash Catalyst, aka Thermo. Every online demo I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of this product looks more and more exciting, and this is truly going to give Mac users a way to do easy interactive prototypes as our PC brothers and sisters can do with tools like Axure. I fully expect to be using this thing when it gets out of Preview release. It&amp;rsquo;s only slightly ironic that his first 5 minutes are talk about how wireframes are by definition, low fidelity, given my last post.</description>

      <description>Scribbles is perhaps the simplest drawing program I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried. The app, created by atebits, gives you 4 tools: brush, move, pan, and zoom. There are 12 brush styles, a color picker, a big slider for brush size, and a layer manager. It looks deceptively simple on the surface, but when you explore a bit, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some really interesting functionalities that even the advanced Mac freehand drawing tools like Sketchbook and ArtRage don&amp;rsquo;t do well.</description>

      <description>In Twitter today, I posted a message that I need to resist putting rounded corners on boxes in wireframes. Then I got a few replies essentially saying that stylized elements shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in wireframes. Context is everything. Taken out of context, it is very difficult to possibly critique a specific design technique without knowing the how and why you&amp;rsquo;re using it. Because of that 140 character constraint in Twitter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really explain that this rounded corner example came from my hybrid high-fidelity wireframing and visual design document I was working on.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s excellent Creative Mornings on physical computing, Zach Klein and Casey Pugh from Vimeo talked about tinkering with Arduino, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. They showed some simple circuit controls using the LEDs and Processing, and then demoed a Daft Punk helmet they created with LEDs, that could then be controlled/drawn on via a Flash UI. Neat stuff. Later, I got to talk to Carl, a freelance developer/interaction designer who turned me onto NYC Resistor.</description>

      <description>As many of my friends and colleagues know, I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people that read David Allen&amp;rsquo;s Getting Things Done, got the religion, and tried various methods for planning and managing project tasks, using both software and paper. In the past few years, like many, I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked my approach, taking bits and pieces from here and there to settle on the solution that&amp;rsquo;s most suitable for the way I work. At this point, any resemblance to GTD might be less noticable, but it&amp;rsquo;s beginnings are there.</description>

      <description>GOOD is a collaborative project that produces a print magazine, website, videos, and events that focus on the greater good and moving the world forward, e.g. towards social and environmental improvement. They donate 100% of contributions for the magazine to one of the non profit orgs they support.
The site is utterly readable and clean, and utilizes a blog format with excellent filtering abilities. I like the layout of the entries on the main pages, which look sort of like index cards laid out across a desk.</description>

Members pay a smaller $20 membership fee and get access to special events where they can mingle with other 1stfans members, may skip lines at film events, and get alerts via flickr, facebook, and twitter. The museum also recently added a crowd-sourced art work tagging interface that allows users to describe work in the collection using free tags, and has utilized Flickr for over a year now to promote events.</description>

      <description>Nintendo provides excellent illustrations to describe the gifting process on the Wii, using storyboards. The gifting page shows a table of contents at the top, for each use case: sending, receiving, confirmation, and faq. Clicking one of the use cases jumps the user down to the storyboard illustrating steps to complete each case. It&#39;s a simple, very clear, and visual. I wish every support site worked that way.

      <description>Hugh Dubberly has released a free E Book on design and development models.
In this book, I have collected over one-hundred descriptions of design and development processes, from architecture, industrial design, mechanical engineering, quality management, and software development. They range from short mnemonic devices, such as the 4Ds (deﬁne, design, develop, deploy), to elaborate schemes, such as Archer’s 9-phase, 229-step “systematic method for designers.” Some are synonyms for the same process; others represent differing approaches to design.</description>

      <description>The New York Times fashion section article, &amp;ldquo;Blogging at a Snail&amp;rsquo;s Pace&amp;rdquo; discusses slow blogging, a near Ludd-like movement against the practice of posting quick and in high volume. It&amp;rsquo;s like slow food versus fast food. Slow bloggers discard the belief that webloggers need to post often, because the reflectiveness of thought and quality of writing suffer. When comparing the slow versus fast differences, Barbara Ganley, a blogger who writes from Vermont had this to say.</description>

      <description>Andy Polaine&amp;rsquo;s review of books for designers.
Although there are several good design websites that occasionally have book reviews, there didn’t seem to be a single place online where you could get constant updates and reviews of new (and sometimes old) design books.
Design books are often expensive and contrary – sometimes the book is worth having for the physical production values alone, sometimes for the images, sometimes for the words and, occasionally, for all three.</description>

Can&amp;rsquo;t wait until Clip N Sling is available for Sling Box owners and more social features are released. We designed a number of very interesting interfaces which don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be available yet.</description>

News sites like Daylife and NewsVine have been coming up with interesting ways of changing user&#39;s expectations of what can exist in global navigation. In some cases, the labels and categories for what appear in global navigation suggest a shifting information architecture that is based on what&#39;s interesting now or what people have been reading.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics Date Selector</title>

      <description>Google Analytics offers one of the most sophisticated date selectors for data filtering that I&#39;ve seen. The interface allows you to filter reports to a single day by clicking one square in a 3 month range. To select a date range, you click the start input, click a day, and do the same for the end date range. Or you can enter dates in the text inputs.
The timeline control allows you to visualize the volume of visitor activity as vertical bars, and adjust the date range by pulling slider handles.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics Drop Down Menus</title>

      <description>I&#39;m a fan of the drop down menus that span a wide area, e.g. the main body or full page, in order to show a wider range of options rather showing fewer in a vertical drop down and forcing navigation through a fly-out tree. This convention is showing up mostly in global navigation, and with the introduction of Microsoft&#39;s Ribbon, we can expect to see more of it.
Google shows buttons with down arrows to indicate that clicking one of those controls will show expanded options in-screen, a la the drop down menu.</description>

      <title>Netflix Mouseover Info</title>

      <description>The video details shown on mouseover in Netflix is one of those behaviors I just take for granted now. They&#39;ve used their quick-loading, shadowed mouseover call outs for years now and they&#39;ve always felt very useful to me and effortless to deal with. They&#39;re always available, and even work in areas you might not expect to see them, like in a recommendation list within a lightbox dialog. The mouseovers even make up for some things that I feel are design shortcomings, like the lack of a feature to show a gallery of poster images or sort by genre in the instant play queue.</description>

      <description>The video queue on Netflix offers a &#34;Quick Add&#34; functionality at the bottom of the queue that lets users search for a particular title and add it to their queue without having to view the video page. It&#39;s a single input with an auto-completion behavior to suggest videos based on what you type. Clicking a title from the suggestion list or hitting return on an exact match adds the video and shows a confirmation.</description>

      <description>Netflix shows a module to signed in users at the top of their home page asking the user to rate recent returns. The module promises to give 2 recommendations immediately after they&#39;ve rated. On sites like Flickr, the recommendation engine is perhaps one of the single best incentives for adding ratings. On a lot of sites, ratings give you nothing back. This is a good example to illustrate quickly why you&#39;d want to add a rating, and would be particularly useful to demonstrate the value to new users.</description>

      <description>Jess McMullin shares his research on choosing a camera for design research on the bplusd blog. His list covers a selection of cameras for still pictures and short video capture. At the end of the summer I chose the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5to complement my Canon SD20 for both work and play. At work I wanted to be able to capture things like white boards, projected presentation screens, and do short video of live screens.</description>

      <description>Napkin Look and Feel is a cool looking open source tool for Java developers to produce application prototypes with a low-fidelity sketchy interface.
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully functional for development. Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code behind it is working.</description>

The service let&amp;rsquo;s you create your own Twitter-clone microblogging site, as does Yammer, but without any constraints regarding who you may invite. Alas, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I know what the experience is like because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the front door, so I walked away possibly never to return.</description>

These days, the design lines between blogs and newspapers are starting to converge a bit with those newspapers that take the threat of the blog format seriously. Smashing Mag does a good design of screenshooting and comparing what news sites are doing. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/11/newspaper-website-design-trends-and-examples/</description>

      <description>ScreenToaster is a pretty incredible web application that lets you record your web browser screen without having to download desktop software. Currently, to record a screen, you open up ScreenToaster in a browser tab, navigate to the page you want to capture, click a keyword combination, and the applet starts recording. Press another key combination to stop. The service saves the session and almost immediately gives you a flash video with your recording.</description>

Icons are well designed and clear, forms are laid out well, everything is perfectly aligned, and page elements direct the user through every facet of administration.</description>

      <description>The art direction on the LittleBigPlanet site is fabulous and fun as hell.

A subject&#39;s buzz score is the percentage of Yahoo! users searching for that subject on a given day, multiplied by a constant to make the number easier to read. Weekly leaders are the subjects with the greatest average buzz score for a given week.
The chart shows current rank, icons for the change in rank over previous day, previous rank position, number of days on chart, score, and score change.</description>

2) Interactive prototypes to test and communicate interactions: Adobe Flex (Thermo may change my mind)

The sharing of knowledge and ideas is of fundamental importance to the advancement of technology. With this goal in mind, MIT’s User Interface Design group meets once a day at Tea Time to brainstorm new ideas, review new technologies and ideas, and share their experiences working in the field.
If we hope to herald innovation by sharing ideas with a research group , then there’s a boundless value to sharing ideas and thoughts with the world at large.</description>

      <description>Yahoo&#39;s hybrid tab/breadcrumb navigation is one of my favorite approaches to global and local navigation. This navigation interface answers a few nagging questions that an interface designer might ask. &#34;How do I present the user with an interface that provides focus on the area they&#39;ve navigated to, while providing a path back or to other main areas of interest?&#34;
What&#39;s interesting here is that they provide a row of primary navigation tabs at the top level, and replace that with a hybrid tab/breadcrumb once the user makes the decision to drill down.</description>

      <description>Gazopa provides image upload and drawing interfaces for image search. The idea of finding similar images by comparing against a submitted image or drawing is not new, but search tools that use this tech have failed to catch on in consumer sites. People with information retrieval background might be familiar with IBM&amp;rsquo;s QBIC, query by image content, technology for instance. Gazopa looks very interesting, and the results are not bad at all, even with my crude bicycle drawing above.</description>

      <description>Product Planner is one an brilliant idea. Deconstruct the user flow of web sites, illustrate the flow with annotated screenshot flowcharts, allow users to copy the flow and reuse on the site. Like Konigi, this does a great job of capturing examples of alternative approaches to interaction, showcases them for you to compare, and allows you to select the best examples to learn from and inform you of approaches you may not have thought of.</description>

      <description>Testing of proof of concept prototypes of radial menus. The idea is to get users to try to select the same menu item repeatedly as the radial menu changes from state to state and capture participants feedback on usability of the interface.

      <title>Effectiveness of Brainstorming</title>

      <description>Found on smartex, and believed by jibbajabba to occasionally be true of group brainstorming&amp;hellip;
Wikipedia on &amp;ldquo;Brainstorming&amp;rdquo;.
Although brainstorming has become a popular group technique, researchers have generally failed to find evidence of its effectiveness for enhancing either quantity or quality of ideas generated. Because of such problems as distraction, social loafing, evaluation apprehension, and production blocking, brainstorming groups are little more effective than other types of groups, and they are actually less effective than individuals working independently.</description>

      <description>Or maybe we&amp;rsquo;re just comfortable with the mix in of apps and music? No, not me. Artist and Album are certainly just wrong. Don&amp;rsquo;t know how they can make that legacy labeling generic across music/movie/application. Creator instead of artist, perhaps. And just leave album blank for apps and movies. Album doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve a purpose for apps does it? The link doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to work.

      <description>Chris Fahey discusses the merits of bespoke UI design, referencing the successful design of John King&#39;s touch wall which was created for King by Perceptive Pixel. Bespoke design--the practice of designing something specifically for and individual--might be more prevalent in the digital world than most people realize. The examples provided out in the quotes of software designers and developers point out the most common case where this is happening. Designers who design products by focusing on what they want/need for themselves is common enough.</description>

      <description>The &#34;In Quotes&#34; project in Google Labs is an interesting attempt to leverage information from Google News to try to help people understand where public figures stand on topics and issues by extracting quotes. Google says &#34;Much of the published reporting about people is based on the interpretation of a journalist. Direct quotes, on the other hand, are concrete units of information that describe how newsmakers represent themselves.&#34;
The interface is pretty simple to use.</description>

Note: You can switch out &amp;ldquo;IA&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Design&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Copywriting&amp;rdquo; or whatever it is you like to do!</description>

They stand out because they&amp;rsquo;ve thought of the problem, researched how to make the better mousetrap and deliver a product that sells the story of sticking your nano wherever you want when you work out. They&amp;rsquo;ve made $50K in 6 months. Excellent stuff.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/twitrratr-sentiment-twitter/</guid>
      <description>twitrratr looks like an interesting attempt to provide some sentiment analysis to Twitter. Do a search for a keyword and twitrratr displays the tweets matching that term, with entries organized in 3 columns: negative, neutral, positive. Some algorithm works in the background to determine the sentiment. The major issue I have with sentiment analysis is that it is not trivial stuff. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of vendors who provide this service to corporations doing analysis of product mentions on the web, the effectiveness of this type of analysis is dependent on the algorithms that crunch text, the amount of text, and language used.</description>

Who on earth says, &#34;Enable the GPS function&#34;? Only user-manual writers and computer-book authors. Say &#34;Turn on GPS&#34; instead.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve caught Chuck Todd using a desktop touch interface a few times on MSNBC to click through poll charts. While John King has been using a Perceptive Pixel-designed touch wall, Todd has been using a Microsoft Surface interface on a desktop. The device and manipulation of data on the screen looks very natural on this show, especially for the kind of information he&amp;rsquo;s speaking to. I think whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of visual information to add to a story, this kind of an interface has potential to be very helpful and I look forward to seeing what they do at MSNBC and on other shows.</description>

      <description>FanSnap is an event ticket search site that provides faceted results filtering. Users simply enter an upcoming event, and FanSnap returns a list of available tickets from vendors like StubHub, provides filtering by price, seating area, and ticket vendor. If a venue diagram is available seats are overlaid over the venue&#39;s seating chart. Users can sort and star/favorite available tickets in their &#34;short list&#34;, and then click a link to purchase the tickets at the ticket vendor&#39;s site.</description>

      <description>Sumopaint, by Snap Group Ltd is looking to be a really slick Flash-based online graphics creation and editing tool. It has a very complete list of functionalities with shapes, brushes, layers, text editing, filters, and many of the features you&amp;rsquo;d expect from Photoshop or (ack) GIMP. Users can share images for community editing, create and view versions, and add comments. This looks like it might turn out to be an excellent resource for those looking at doing things like shared whiteboarding and prototyping without the real-time editing.</description>

      <description>Apple&#39;s accordion module provides a method for displaying a good deal of informational and promotional content without overwhelming the interface. The types of things that are displayed in these are accordions are usually supporting content, so the desire to use a design pattern that hides and shows these panels of content is useful. Only one panel is visible at a time, and hovering over or clicking a panel heading brings its content into view with a smooth slide transition.</description>

      <description>Apple&#39;s Coverflow-like carousels are used on interior pages of Apple.com to provide visual navigation of products using product images. A set of images is displayed in a wide panel with a horizontal scrollbar. Carousels are used primarily for promotion when most sites place a set of images in this upper area of the screen below the navigation. Apple utilizes this space to provide better findability of products within each section of the site.</description>

      <description>Hulu&#39;s new 3-up carousel is being utilized in the site&#39;s channels sections to offer a promotional space that takes up less screen height than their 1 up carousel, allowing the display of 3 promo items. This is very similar to the horizontal scrolling Cover Flow module in use on Apple.com interior pages.
1. First set of channels. Scroll bar below allows the user to view more.2. Second set of channels. Hovering over a channel reveals it&#39;s name and an &amp;quot;explore&amp;quot; button to jump to it.</description>

      <description>Hulu&#39;s drop down menu for channels stretches to the width of the design and provides a multi-column grid of channels. This method of running a drop down or flyout menu left-to-right rather than top-to-bottom allows interface designers to present longer lists of options without worrying about what appears in relation to the fold, and forcing scroll on longer lists.

      <description>Seems like someone has come up with a better solution for marking my note and sketch pages in my Moleskines. Dog eared pages never suited me, and the colored tabs I get at MUJI and the occasional PostIt note are OK. But I love the idea of these magnetic page markers from Folio because it means I won&amp;rsquo;t need to buy anymore sticky tabs from the stationery store. And the little pointed arrows are pretty useful for pointing out lines of interest in books too.</description>

      <description>Jared Spool writes an excellent article describing how to give a good design critique. A well-done critique is a way to step away from the specifics of the design process and better understand how to create great designs. We do this by starting with the current design and asking &#34;What is it we&#39;re really trying to do here?&#34; and &#34;How close are we to doing it?&#34;
 The design crit is one of the most valuable parts of the design process to me.</description>

      <description>Victor Lombardi discusses concept design in Digital Web Magazine, pointing out that digital designers should take some inspiration from design processes for ideation and concept generation from the fields of architecture and industrial design. I think the main idea is to learn from the practices and methods from these fields, and use that as inspiration for what might be useful in your concept design practice. That is not to say that every project needs to result in a dozen concepts that need to be prototyped at high fidelity and therefore at significant cost.</description>

      <description>In Flow Interactive&amp;rsquo;s blog, Phil Barrett offers advice for those who are considering implementing Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Ribbon in their applications. The Ribbon has received praise from usability folks who see the benefit this offers in terms of ease of use and better, more visible contextual controls. But it has also met with resistance from individuals who find the large menu-heavy approach disruptive.
The ribbon is a decent piece of interface, but like most things in UX, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to design it well.</description>

This is something I typically do at the start of a usability test to see what users understand at a high level. Show them a screen, take it away, have them talk, ask them questions.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more appropriate site for a cute hand drawn interface than for The Back of the Napkin book site. This is a great book for anyone who wants to expand their tools for business thinking. Dan Roam provides a friendly approach and simple formula to using drawing to collect, analyze, and communicate problems and ideas, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be good at drawing to do it.</description>

      <description>Daytum comes to us from the data obsessed minds of visual designers, Nick Felton and Ryan Case. Felton is the creator of the Feltron personal annual report that we Tufte/stats junkies love and Case is the creative director working on the social media experience at Sling Media. DAYTUM is a wonderful evolution of the personal annual report, bringing obsessive loggers a place to count whatever comes to mind and visualize that data beautifully in the personal and community space.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Pilot and Pentel mechanical pencils. At home I use the larger Pentels, but when I&amp;rsquo;m out, I carry around the small red Pilot Couleur above attached to my small Moleskine. Ideas often come when I&amp;rsquo;m away from the desk so I feel like I always have to have pencil and paper wherever I go. The Pilots have a rubberized coating, hold 0.5mm leads, and hide an eraser under the push button.</description>

      <description>The promo site for the new Wario Land Wii game takes you into the world of the big garlicky brute as he stomps through the screen, shaking the interface up, much as he did with the YouTube promo. The big gimmick with this site is that you have to shake objects in the interface to navigate from section to section. The rest of the site makes use of a hunt for objects to keep you engaged as you explore the story and game play features.</description>

      <description>My son got his hands on the storyboard paper and started sketching a stop motion animation sequence in the cells. He just started his second session in a stop motion class. This is one of the things I used our printed graph paper for, but because that was printed in black/gray on our laser printer, I had a hard time knocking out the grid lines mixed in with his drawings.</description>

      <description>37 signals gave the soapbox to crowdSPRING to justify the crowdsourcing and spec work platform and the debate ensued. I got through about half of the long rant, then half of the comments, and called it a day. I&#39;ve already chimed in about my opinion for crowdSPRING. I believe there is a place for this market, and if small businesses will support it with dollars, then it will continue to exist.</description>

      <description>Ars reports on a study by the psychology department at NC State that will appear in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. The study tested how college students respond to fake dialog boxes in browser popup windows and found that the students are so anxious to get the dialog out of the way, they click right through obvious warning signs. Follow-up questions revealed that the students seemed to find any dialog box a distraction from their assigned task; nearly half said that all they cared about was getting rid of these dialogs.</description>

      <description>A Flickr Group with covers from fashion mag, The Face. As an undergrad in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s, I was friends with an art dealer I worked with for a few years who read this magazine. He used to let me borrow his clothes, and the thing I took most of the time was his The Face t-shirt that I&amp;rsquo;d wear with a black jacket. This set of photos brings back funny memories of that NYC gallery scene.</description>

      <description>Sugar Inc. releases the OnSugar Blogging platform to let Sugar community members start their own sites. Based on the Drupal platform, OnSugar provides some very nice modifications to clean up and simplify the posting and content management interfaces provided by the popular open source CMS. What I like most about what they&#39;ve done with Drupal is the clean tabbed UI for content creation, the media embedding options for inserting images from Getty, ShopStyle, and Fashion week photos, and the excellent spread editor.</description>

The first round of gear will include wireframe and storyboard notepads. Each of these pads include 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software.</description>

This tool kit will definitely make the job even easier.</description>

      <description>CNet reports on Swype, a new keyboard technology for touch screens created by the inventory of the T9 keyboard technology for numeric keypads. Swype lets the user drag their finger across the screen, touching each of the letters in the words they want to enter, and predictive software selects the word they wanted. This could be a great tool to the improve the typing experience on the iPhone, which I find pretty awful compared to a hardware keyboard.</description>

It completely makes up for the less than exciting experience I had with Enso, which never came close to a Quicksilver experience on Windows. Ubiquity is pretty much the Quicksilver experience brought to your web browser. A smart tool that is summoned by a keyboard shortcut, and provides shortcuts to frequently used tools, and contextually relevant paths to using selected content in the page.</description>

      <description>The slight redesign of the surface on Fancast is a lovely updating that comes along with the site&amp;rsquo;s latest release and new inventory of video content. The presentation layer is sporting the clean and glossy look of white boxes with pale drop shadows that I&amp;rsquo;m fond of, as well as using soft white bevels with enough restraint to look good without going over the top. The overall look is softer, and might slightly reference the minimalist Hulu, but clearly outsexes that site.</description>

      <description>The Fancast has a simple video player interface with typical features. No advanced features like clipping (although it does allow sharing scenes) and the features it does have are not available in full screen mode. Additionally, accessing any of those features, e.g. sharing and embedding, pauses playback. I like the simplicity of the design, but the video player could reach some parity in terms of functionality with what video users are becoming accustomed to.</description>

      <description>YouTube&#39;s localization options limit content to submissions from a particular country, and the language selection options allow users to change the interface language. This is one of those interfaces that becomes clear when you&#39;ve clicked the links, because the option are hidden until you click the &#34;Worldwide&#34; link. Qualifying labels like &#34;Content: World | Lang: En (US)&#34; might make these very obvious. It&#39;s nice that YouTube gives you that content selector.</description>

      <description>Ars Technica reports on the 3.1 Alpha of Firefox, which includes support for the HTML 5 Video element which provides some functionality to developers that is not possible with Flash. Video can be interspersed with other web content, playback can be manipulated with JavaScript, and video elements can be directly accessed through the document object model.

      <description>3 recent articles show how to get interactive effects on menus, proving that you don&amp;rsquo;t need Flash for this kind of simple interactivity.  Dave Shea&amp;rsquo;s tutorial in ALA shows how to create interactive menu hover effects using CSS sprites and the JQuery Javascript library. A sprite image is a single graphic with multiple states mapped on the graphic, a technique borrowed from game design, where game characters are shown in different states of action.</description>

      <description>The portfolio site of the Jeremy Levine Design does an excellent job highlighting the work of an architecture studio with interests in both the natural and digital environment. The site unfolds, spins, explodes, and collapses on itself to immerse the user in the projects, exploring each environment from multiple facets. The studio worked with Section Seven to realize a site that borrows some of the techniques used in that studio&amp;rsquo;s own portfolio, but contextualizes the experience for exploring 3 dimensional architectural spaces.</description>

The beta provides a search interface at the top of the home and results pages to set parameters including location, size, type of space, and budget. Slider controls are used to narrow size and budget. At present, changes in these settings require a manual page submission to update results. The top location shows some limitations on the number of visible values that can be displayed.</description>

      <description>Jakob Nielsen&#39;s Alertbox reports on their study of sitemaps, observing that among the sites they tested, sitemaps continue to be a useful tool to some people. While their study shows that they are rarely used, they can be simple, inexpensive tools to generate for the users who find value in the sense-making cues that a visual overview provides. Their recommendation is to continue to use them if you already produce them, but keep them static and don&#39;t add interactive effects to them.</description>

      <description>CNET redesigns its identity and with it, all of its sites now sport a cleaner, more modern aesthetic. Some claim that the original c|Net, with the block of yellow navigation on the left hand side was responsible for the proliferation of that layout type in the 90&amp;rsquo;s. Today there is only a hint of yellow, and that left sidebar that held most of the site navigation is now relegated to a simpler, singular category or local navigation purpose within a section.</description>

The main page of CNET TV features the video player in the center stage, with a short list of featured (hot) content flanking the left side, and a playlist on the right showing the currently playing video. The player controls are simple and easy to use, but at full screen, the controls a little soft and blurry.</description>

      <description>Not sure if the user on Vimeo who posted this is THE Woz, but he or she posted this concept user interface for an iPhone menu application that looks very interesting. The video opens with a UI that displays falling media that appear like little square stamps dropping like leaves to a desktop with contacts, photos, videos, etc. on the face of the leaves. The user can apparently pick up one of the pieces, and if it&amp;rsquo;s a video for example, start playing that video in the UI.</description>

In short, the deep treasure trove of content unleashed in this redesign is a huge departure from the tightly constrained and minimalist prior design.</description>

From her about page, she says &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;I’ve been using them in my work, my personal life and as a tool to help companies work faster, more collaboratively, and to make smart decisions that stick. In 2007, I began speaking to groups about these simple, cheap, ubiquitous and powerful tools.</description>

      <description>The WB brings its video site to the masses of OC and Friends fans and adds another network portal into the mix with Hulu. In terms of visual appearances and the high level navigation (IA), TheWB.com feels like the polar opposite in sensibility to Hulu&#39;s pared down appearances and very usable directory structure and show pages. On Hulu, once you arrive at a show page, everything you can watch whether it be a full episode or clip, is neatly organized and presented on the page.</description>

      <description>The VideoEgg Advertising Network site uses vertical tabs along the right of the page with labels properly oriented in the north-south direction. While doing tabs this way requires that they be handled as images or Flash, the metaphor is recognizable and its use makes sense immediately. Local navigation is handled inside the banner area. 1. Vertical tabs along right side of page.2. Navigation detail. Local navigation seen in the large banner area to the left of the tabs.</description>

      <description>Yahoo! Buzz pulls actively viewed and shared pages from its portal and puts them in a Digg-like interface with vote-to-promote buttons so users may actively push stories up and down the Buzz list. The digg/bury interface is simple. Stories are categorized by several main topic areas, and users may view the stories with the highest vote count, over several time slices, or sorted by recency.
1. When the user visits the site the first time, a guided tour jumps the user around the page to introduce them to the site&#39;s features.</description>

      <description>Paper manufacturer NewPage provides the Ed Lives Here site, a useful resource with information about paper, printing, and design. One of the features of this site is a glossary of printing terms. The glossary provides categorized sub-glossaries, as well as the typical a-z index of terms, and a search input. Browsing through the glossary is facilitated by the A-Z links, which use a fish eye lens to bring focus to a section of the list.</description>

      <description>The Sesame Workshop and PBS produce excellent Flash sites for kids. Among my favorites are the Sesame Street and Arthur sites. The recent redesign of the Sesame Street site adds new navigation options, a more YouTube-like video section, and most notably, user profiles. The best of the new features is the ability to add favorites to &amp;ldquo;Your Street,&amp;rdquo; a user profile page that uses your favorites to display a start page.</description>

      <description>Bill Buxton gives a lecture at the Stanford University Human-Computer Interaction Seminar (CS 547, June 1, 2007) giving an excellent deep dive into some of the topics in his book, Sketching User Experiences.
 Designing for experience comes with a whole new level of complexity. This is especially true in this emerging world of information appliances, reactive environments, and ubiquitous computing, where, along with those of their users, we have to factor in the convoluted behaviors of the products themselves.</description>

      <description>About 10 years ago I participated in the daily indexing of news articles as part of my job designing a digital library. During graduate study for the MLS my concentration was actually on information retrieval and classification, so I was interested in doing the job and understanding the content in order to know how to make it useful to users. Customers would get this information via the web site, by email, and in newsletters.</description>

      <description>Flickr&#39;s edit in place behaviors make it easy to change data on records without requiring the round trip to a full page editor form. They provided one of the earliest examples of this behavior, using AJAX to quickly update fields in place, and has remained the model to emulate for some time.
1. Flickr entry in user&#39;s photos page.2. Hovering over the title field highlights it with background color to provide a subtl alert the user that it can be edited.</description>

      <description>Diving deeply into problem analysis or early bottom up activity is not typical activity for experienced and successful designers. A more flexible approach and parallel thought processes and activities are more characteristic. That is the observation of Nigel Cross in an essay he writes in the Design Studies Journal.
Victor Lombardi sparks a great debate about design process on Noise Between Stations while discussing the differences in approach to process between expert and novice designers, as described by Nigel Cross and Henrik Gedenryd in their independent research on the topic.</description>

This forward looking concept focuses on 4 high priority elements: context awareness, natural interaction, continuity, and multi-user applications.
Aurora (Part 1) from Adaptive Path on Vimeo. The scenario laid out is one in which one user starts an audio chat and screen sharing sesion with another user and we begin to see how users can find information from their history and share it and remix it with others in the session.</description>

      <description>The CNN News portal provides a very dense global navigation header that&#39;s got quite a bit going on, but succeeds in drawing out the main entry points for news, featured or promoted points of interest, language/edition preference setting, search, and even a sticky alert area for late breaking news. It even borrows the idea of hot topics navigation per section from Newsvine, which allows for a more variable set of local navigation based on what&#39;s happening now, rather than on a rigid top-down IA.</description>

      <description>The redesigned del.icio.us site provides drop down navigation to signed in users. Clicking the navigation label jumps to that section, or click the arrow to drill down in that section. They provide separators in the drop-down to chunk up the navigation options. There&#39;s some inconsistency in the treatment of selected sections. The blue background of the nav link on Home implies selected color. But if you click the links in the global nav, the blue background on Home remains on Home.</description>

      <description>del.icio.us&#39; tag filtering provides an excellent interface design for filtering tags without having to scan your tag list or tag bundles, which can turn out quite long over time. In a control area that looks and behaves like a hybrid breadcrumb trail, you enter a tag into an input. Tag suggestions are provided as you type. Build up that filter by adding tags, and each tag in your crumb path can be removed independent of the path you took by clicking the tag&#39;s adjacent X icon.</description>

Each has 10px gutters on either side or 20px combined between columns. 960 px was chosen as a base number because it is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, 80, 96, 120, 160, 192, 240, 320 and 480.</description>

People wanting a full featured tool like Morae won&amp;rsquo;t find their solution here, but if all you want is to organize test sessions, capture audio/video of screen interactions and participants face and voice, then Silverback might be for you.</description>

      <description>The Heads of State are a 2 person design studio in Brooklyn and Seattle. Their recently redesigned site showcases the strong portfolio of print work on projects including book covers, magazine illustrations, and corporate identity. I love the simple, powerful covers on the Rosenfeld Media books, and after diving into their site, I think I&amp;rsquo;d love even more to hire them in the future.

      <description>emastic is an interesting looking CSS Framework that is designed for both fixed and fluid layout. It looks like a nice alternative to fluid layouts than YUI Grids, with simpler and more flexible column structuring and class naming.
* Lightweight (compressed weight less then 4kb)
* Personalized width of the page in (em,px,%)
* Use of fixed and fluid columns in the grid.
* Elastic Layout with &amp;ldquo;em&amp;rdquo;s  Blueprint is going to have to catch up and produce a version for fluid layouts.</description>

      <description>In Last.fm&#39;s redesign, the site started combining vertical tabs along the left hand side of the content area, and horizontal tabs in the main content area for sub-navigation. This is not something I would recommend. There is something rather unnatural feeling to me when vertical tabs along a Y axis are laid out with text in the West-East orientation. I think for the metaphor to make sense, the South-North orientation has to be respected, as though you were stacking real manila folders.</description>

      <description>Where Google Search gave us syntax for doing all kinds of advanced searching, Google Calendar goes a more natural route. When Calendar was released, it introduced a lot of people to the idea of the natural language command line for the web via the &#34;Quick Add&#34; feature. Via a simple form input, you enter basic event info, e.g. &#34;Lunch with Judy on Thusday at 1pm.&#34; The event is quickly added, and you click the event title in the calendar to edit the details.</description>

I was noticing that when I print these in grayscale on a black and white laser printer, that the blues were a bit too pale to print clearly. This version works very well when printed. Color printer users will still be able to knock out the blue.

To use, enter event statements as with Google Calendar. It is always assumed that you are the subject&amp;#8212;the WHO. You just have to fill in the rest of the WHAT, WITH WHOM, and WHERE parts of the statement, e.g. &#34;Have lunch with Judy on Thursday at 1pm.&#34; Once you&#39;ve submitted the basic event info, you&#39;re presented with a more complete UI for entering event details, and this is where the service far surpasses Google&#39;s.</description>

The icons you see here are some of the ones I plan to include in this new set. Any others you&amp;rsquo;d like to see here that aren&amp;rsquo;t already represented? These are the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve actually had to use in the past 3 or 4 years.</description>

      <description>Balsamiq Mockups is an incredible application for creating user interface mockups. The application allows you layout interface sketches using the 50 interface controls included. Controls are added to the canvas or notebook by dragging and dropping or by using an insert input with auto-completion suggestions. As with Visio, many controls may be easily customized by editing values in the properties panel, and may be modified to show state, e.g. selected, disabled, etc.</description>

      <description>Matthew Pennel&amp;rsquo;s Grid Calculator is a tool to calcuate a grid based on easy to use slider controls and forms. [A]llows you to choose the font size you are going to use, and then select the number of columns, column width, and gutter width based on that base font size. As you fiddle with the dimensions, the total width is dynamically updated, so you can check that you haven’t gone over that magic 1024px!</description>

      <description>Andrew Ingram&amp;rsquo;s GridMaker is a brilliant script for Photoshop that can be used to automatically generate guides in your PSD. The script allows you to enter the series of columns that should be laid out both horizontally and vertically. Then you set the maximum dimensions for the canvas. To generate a Blueprint grid, for instance, you&amp;rsquo;d enter &amp;ldquo;30,10&amp;rdquo; to create a PSD with a series of repeating columns of alternating 30 pixel units and 10 pixel gutters.</description>

You may want to impress your client with the vast amount of knowledge that you have, however, if they do not understand it, then all of your effort is lost. &amp;hellip; [W]hen explaining a concept, slow down, provide examples and talk in familiar terms.

Pencil is an application that runs on the Mozilla Gecko engine and can be run as a Firefox 3 tool, or in standalone mode (Windows and Linux only for now). The first version looks very promising and provides the basic functionalities needed to create diagrams and page schematics.</description>

      <description>Brazilian web designer Fabio Sasso provides a tutorial describing how he creates a site in Fireworks. I&#39;m not a Fireworks user, but this blog entry caught my eye because of how instructive and thoroughly illustrated it is. I&#39;m a loyal Photoshop user and don&#39;t intend to drop dollars for another graphics program, but the examples here make Fireworks look pretty darned nice.

      <description>The new Blogger Draft text editor shares some of the behaviors of the rich text editor in Gmail, and as commenter points out, uses the same icons used in Google Pages. Blogger and Pages use beveled buttons rather than using the more minimalist style of the borderless icons in Gmail. One might argue that these controls are actually more usable because the states of toggles and the affordances supplied by buttons and dropped down menus should be obvious.</description>

      <description>Continuum&amp;rsquo;s Javascript Ratio Calculator is a handy tool you can use to calculate object dimensions based on a ratio you provide. You can do this easily in a graphics tool like Photoshop by setting an image size and resizing, but this can be useful when you just need to pull those dimensions out when planning a project layout.

      <description>The portfolio site of Erwin Bauer takes a different approach to using a pannable user interface, but implementing in JavaScript rather than in Flash. The site allows users to click and drag to pan the canvas, or to use links positioned around the content to move around. The design is clean, and mimics a design document with regisration and crop marks, and visual cues about the directions the canvas will pan to when you navigate.</description>

Adobe is providing optimized Adobe Flash Player technology to Google and Yahoo! to enhance search engine indexing of the Flash file format (SWF) and uncover information that is currently undiscoverable by search engines.
 This player will apparently behave like user going through a Flash site and index content as it interacts with the site.</description>

      <description>Google have been doing some work getting some of their interfaces to be consistent with each other. GMail and Blogger now provide similar interface behaviors and controls, with slight differences. Other applications like Google Sites and Docs continue to have different controls.
Gmail and Blogger are among the simplest of these text editor interfaces, for good reason. In blogs and email, rich text formatting should be bare bones and out of the way as much as possible.</description>

      <description>Yahoo! Mail&#39;s rich text editor in the composition form is clean and provides the core set of formatting options you&#39;d need. The implementation is simple and intuitive. A few things they do differently include: rolling some commonly visible controls into drop down menus, e.g. text alignment and list style blocks.
1. Font face selection and font size are in HTML form selects. 2. Font color selection. Highlight or background color uses the same color selection control.</description>

      <description>SproutCore has been getting some buzz after the June Apple WWDC, where SproutCore was demoed. This is an MVC framework that builds a standards-based application that runs entirely in the browser and is not tied to a single scripting language to power the back end. The framework is being used to drive the new MobileMe service from Apple.
SproutCore is a framework for building applications in JavaScript with remarkably little amounts of code.</description>

      <description>TNOP&amp;rsquo;s site is as minimalist as they come. A form select lets users navigate sections, and viewing content requires horizontal scrolling. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of horizontal scrolling, especially if I have to use the scroll bar versus an in-page control, but it&amp;rsquo;s bare bones and well executed so I like it.

So what’s hot now? Pencil sketches, handwritten notes, card stocks, watercolor effects, collage art, script fonts, grungy and splatter ink backgrounds (glossy gradients are not &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; this year). Another trend to be on the lookout for are the vintage and retro styles which I’ve posted earlier this year. Here is a list of 82 sites picked from Best Web Gallery that show the current design trends.</description>

You&#39;ll find styles for wireframing user interfaces, and story boarding interaction. I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s also used by animators and filmmakers. Enjoy.
 Scanning These cyan and gray grid pages are great for sketching, but also work well when producing high fidelity drawings. The boxes and grid lines of the cyan versions are non-photo blue, so you can easily remove them when scanned.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time sketching interface ideas on paper. Typically I sketch wireframes and storyboards on graph paper, then redo the final documents in OmniGraffle. But lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using paper for more than just sketching. Now, after spending time sketching ideas and working out design issues, I start to do higher fidelity drawings on paper, scan them, post them to our system. We discuss and iterate, and the process repeats until we&amp;rsquo;re happy, and I spend less time pushing pixels around.</description>

10 principles of design according to Rams:
 Good design is innovative. Good design makes a product useful. Good design is aesthetic. Good design helps us to understand a product. Good design is unobtrusive. Good design is honest. Good design is durable. Good design is consequent to the last detail. Good design is concerned with the environment.</description>

      <description>Performancing Metrics is a web analytics product that is focussed on Blog Systems. Their reporting views provide an highly scalable solution for data filtering that takes up very little screen real estate, yet provides a powerful mechanism for adding criteria to do granular reports. This example shows an ad-hoc filtering of the Visitors data on their demo server.
This solution, showing an inline set of filter criteria on a single row contrasts with several typical filtering techniques that can be used.</description>

      <description>My first impression when landing on the MAD Museum site is that there is a sense dynamic tension between the huge decorative shapes that make up the bold MAD logo and the clean layout, whose grid and the solid blocks of type and photos feel very modern. There is an appropriate feeling in that tension that works well to characterize a museum like this, that houses objects of such a wide range of styles and periods.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s easily on my list of favorites and is one of the nicest portfolios to look at. What I like about this site, besides the very clean visual design, is that it provides a very usable example of a zoomable user interface.</description>

This is a very simple wiki created on top of Drupal. They&amp;rsquo;ve done a nice job of creating a core set of wiki pages (&amp;ldquo;indices&amp;rdquo;, as they call them) linked off the front so you can edit those pages and create forward links to new resources.</description>

      <title>A Peek Inside Google&amp;acirc;��s Gmail Usability Lab</title>

      <description>TechCrunch has some photos of a usability lab used by the Gmail team at Google. Some of the photos include earlier iterations of Google Chat that were being tested in the lab.
I only see shots of the observers&amp;rsquo; room in the photos, but there&amp;rsquo;s some description of their testing room as well.
It’s a small room with a large flat screen monitor, along with a desk and computer. It also has a number of discrete cameras (and a microphone) that keep an eye on the user herself as well as the screen.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of splash pages, but I really like the illustrations on the splash screen menu and the minimal approach to navigation. I could see repeating the illustrations in the header as well, though, rather than using the pop up menu. I also think it would be nice if they would be shown in color on the splash page. Those great illustrations shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hidden. The layout is clean and the style is very soft and elegant.</description>

      <description>Boxes and Arrows has a very detailed tutorial by Alexa Andrzejewski, interaction designer at Adaptive Path, on creating prototypes in Flash. To tackle the classic “how to prototype rich interactions” problem, I developed a process for translating static screen designs (from wireframes to visual comps) into interactive experiences using Flash. Requiring some fairly basic ActionScript knowledge, these prototypes proved to be a quick yet powerful way to bring interaction designs to life.</description>

      <description>Daisy is an artist that does incredible things with balloons. The site presently shows some amazing dresses fabricated with the long balloons you&amp;rsquo;d usually only see in the form of little animals, but Daisy elevates the art to design amazing clothing that could be called haute couture. I could easily imagine these things being made out of a less ephemeral material and being worn, albeit a bit uncomfortably.</description>

      <description>Brooklyn visual designer Jason Santa Maria redesigns his site with a more flexible system that will allow him to adapt the design of each entry to suit the content. He notes that this is a redefined focus on art direction, and a magazine approach to content publishing outside of the typical confines of a CMS templating system.
I liked previous site design, and its reference to physical print. But I find that while the new visual style might refer back to the feeling of print, this visual style is more appealing to me as a someone who tends to be drawn to modern design.</description>

Users enter their comment and search for anything from an artist to a track to find content to recommend. The selected content is embedded in the comment to be played in the media player.
The interface is similar to those provided in the MTV recommendations app on Facebook and the Video embedding control in Gawker Media comments.</description>

      <description>The Secret Location is an agency that works on interactive, film, animation, and motion graphics. Their portfolio exemplifies their work, by providing an immersive flash experience around a conjured up story leading a character to follow a mysterious path that leads to the secret location. Luckily the story is short and engaging, because that location leads down the path to the real goods, the company site and portfolio. Once you summon the remote control in the lower left menu, you navigate with a pretty simple hierarchical tree to drill down into the portfolio.</description>

Los Angeles based social network MySpace, which has 115 million monthly visitors worldwide (Comscore, April 2008), will be launching a redesign of its site next week. The first phase of the project, internally called “MySpace 2.0,” will launch on Wednesday June 18.
The changes affect five major areas of the service: homepage, navigation, profile editor, search and the MySpaceTV Flash player.</description>

      <description>Camspace is pretty slick. The people at CamTrax are demoing the PC camera-based interface. At first blush, I thought it similar to the gimicky Eye Toy games, but this is much better. CamTrax is a software-based technology that enables the tracking of hand-held objects in real time, with high reliability. What you see in the demo is that the software recognizes the hand-held objects and effectively turns them into pointers and other controls that can be used to act on the simple end as a cursor, and on the more sophisticated end as a game controller.</description>

DestroyFlickr explores alternative methods for viewing and sharing Flickr content. Its user interface provides an environment that benefits photos rather than hindering them. With the ability to look at a photo on a dark, neutral background, you can view it without the interference of a brighter surrounding. By using workspaces and canvases, DestroyFlickr is able to retain a constant history of where you have navigated, offering the ability to revisit an area without the need to reload the entire page.</description>

      <description>NameThis is an innovative new crowdsourced community that uses the wisdom of crowds to name products and services. Companies or individuals who are looking to name something pay $99 to request help in naming the thing. Participants provide suggestions and vote or invest a stake in the suggestions that have been posted. Kluster&amp;rsquo;s robots decide which is best, and participants get paid back when they&amp;rsquo;ve invested in the winner. You can find out more about how it works.</description>

      <description>I have to admit, that this crowdsourced color explorer is one of the coolest ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in, oh, the last few weeks. On the Dolores blog, Brendan explains how Mechanical Turk was used to present a set of random colors to participants in an exercise designed to observe how people name colors. The project was inspired by the World Color Survey. The result was the color explorer, aka &amp;ldquo;The Amazing Color Label Wheel!</description>

      <description>OfficeMax displays an a-z index of the store directory in the global navigation. When users hover over any of the letters, a page-wide flyout menu appears to display entries. Clicking on one of the letters, displays the same listing of entries in full page view.

      <description>OfficeMax search provides faceted filtering of results using controls in a left sidebar. Facets such as category, brand, and price show 5 terms per facet, allow the user to expand to see more terms if any, add and remove facet selections in any order. A breadcrumb trail is also provided to show the selections made, and can be used to clear all selections at once by clicking on the first term in the trail.</description>

      <description>Erlend posted on the Artueel blog about a great idea they had for mobile designers&amp;#8212;a sketchpaper document you can print out (PDF and PSD formats available) so you can get your ideas on paper. They&amp;rsquo;ve created sketchpaper for the iPhone and the Nokia N95. Since we‘re all big fans of the iPhone and the mobile future in general, we want to help the mobile designer achieving his goals. For those who like to sketch the design/flow of their mobile app or website we present you: sketch paper for the iPhone and Nokia N95.</description>

      <description>You remember Webmonkey, that web design resource many of us grew up with when we were cutting our teeth on HTML. Wired redesigned and re-launched with a few new articles, and some of the old tutes and cheat sheets seem to have been updated. The entire code library appears to be a wiki, so it&amp;rsquo;s open for editing. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep our eyes open to see if anyone kicks in some quality material.</description>

      <description>YouTube have added media annotation controls that allow users to add comment bubbles, note boxes, and links (within YouTube only) to their own videos. YouTube is not the first to add media annotations or commenting features like this, but the addition of this feature may mean we&#39;ll see more if it on video portals. The feature is similar to the video annotation that Bubbleply does. Viewers are not allowed to add annotations to other users&#39; media as is done on Flickr and iminlikewithyou.</description>

      <description>Yugo Nakamura and the Simone Inc. crew are serving up some sick Flash once again for Uniqlo. This time, the mini site is devoted to women&amp;rsquo;s bras. The mood is cheerful as happy electronic strings accompany the dizzying array of women&amp;rsquo;s headshots spinning and combining to create patterns in 3D space. Click on a picture to reveal the details (in Japanese) of one of the women&amp;rsquo;s age, height, and bra size, or use the pop up menus to filter the set down.</description>

      <description>typeish is a showcase of images, joining sites such as ffffound and weheartit. The site notes that it differentiates itself by limiting the participants to a select group that will curate the gallery. Stylistically, the yellow legal pad with scribbles and coffee stains makes this site stand out from the bunch of galleries out there, which I generally categorize at either end of the spectrum as either minimalist with few graphics or textured, 3 dimensional or glossy on the other end.</description>

      <description>Tom Peters does a brain dump of the main ideas he&amp;rsquo;s discussed about design in the past 15 years. In his list, he drops some thoughts that simply reflect the era of the present and past 15 years, and in others he provides nuggets of wisdom. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sampling.
 Everybody&amp;rsquo;s doin&amp;rsquo; it Small things are often (usually?) more important than big things.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; is about the way every individual conducts himself or herself.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you might be itching to get some of those ideas out into the world. oDesk is a resource for finding and tracking freelance developers to work on your project. If you want to get your sketches into the hands of someone who will make it real, this might be a useful resource.</description>

      <description>Graphpaper Press is Thad Allender&amp;rsquo;s repository of minimal themes for WordPress that are built on the Blueprint CSS framework. Allender is creating 1 new skin every month in 2008. The first in the series are the Gridline themes, a pared down, minimal design that comes in three flavors: lite, news, and magazine. Any of these should provide a barebones framework for a small business looking to use WordPress to get their site up and running quickly.</description>

      <description>Buffalo&amp;rsquo;s site is simple on the surface, with very few pages. What I like most are the transitions when you click to view their work. AJAX is used to display work in-page, similar to the functionality of a lightbox, but doing away with transitions typically indicated by graying out the background. This version displays the portfolio panel with a close icon. They also use AJAX to toggle visibility, e.</description>

      <description>Laura Richardson writes in interactions magazine, May/June 2008 (subscription required for full text) about a philosophy of industrial design whose goal is to &amp;ldquo;get to the heart of the matter&amp;#8212;meaningful interactions at the core of great product design.&amp;rdquo; In a sense, I can boil this down to needs. People have needs, explicit and unexpressed, that have to be described in relation to your product. The successful products are those where the flow between need and fulfillment are fluid and natural.</description>

      <description>Facebook have announced to developers that they are going to remove the installation requirement screen and allow users to try an application before installing it. What this means is that users won&amp;rsquo;t see the intimidating list of checkboxes to try an application out, and will get to install the application afterwards. This was meant as a preventative measure against spammy methods used by some applications. The developer announcement described the migration to the new requirements.</description>

      <description>This is a clean, minimalist portfolio. I like the grid of projects in the portfolio and the simple project pages and slideshows. The feeling is very clean and easy to read, even with medium contrast gray text. The brown/orange accent color works very well on buttons and highlighted text.
The only thing I thought odd was that the site name didn&amp;rsquo;t accompany the logo in the upper left. I realize the name is visible title bar and footer, but it might be useful to see near the logo if you arrived from an inner page.</description>

      <description>SOFAMADE are a design and development shop in Arlington, Texas. What I liked about their site most was the bold front page colors and intro paragraph with inline links and the wide 2 and 3 column grids that varied from page to page. The layout of the text-heavy Approach page and the Portfolio pages is clean and easy to read, although I thought the Approach pages did a better job at indicating the hierarchy of page elements.</description>

      <description>David Travis reports for UserFocus on &#34;ISO 2082, Ease of Operation of Every Day Products.&#34; While web-focussed interaction designers and information architects may not be involved in the design of everyday products, we should probably be interested at a high level, in the processes discussed. As Travis points out, clients are increasingly concerned with objective measurements of usability, and standards such as this &#34;...will help ensure that we have robust and reliable test methods for all interactive designs, whether these are products, software or web sites.</description>

The site uses single, short action words set in very large type to indicate what you can do and name the sections of the site: Discover, Learn, Explore, Act, Give. These are nice pathfinder-type labels. When the user hovers over a links, the label expands to provide a phrase. For example, Learn becomes &#34;</description>

Prior to the introduction of this interface, users had to go to click the &#34;All Sizes&#34; link to find URLs for the item.

      <description>Webware reports that Chris Prince, a lead Gears engineer, provided some insight into what Google plans to do with Gears to advance the web browser&amp;rsquo;s reach into the desktop. Among the features mentioned are notifications on the desktop of various events, support for location information, better interactions with a computer&amp;rsquo;s file system, and technology to let large file uploads proceed even when hampered by intermittent network connectivity. Prince demonstrated the following prototypes:</description>

      <description>Here are 2 recent articles that discuss why small teams are more effective than larger ones.  Great Numbers, Not So Great Design, by Khoi Vinh in Subtraction
This craft, and whatever pretensions to art it can pull off, rests so much on the efficiency of transferring ideas from the brain to the hand. This means that in its ideal form, it works best when practiced by a single person. The perfect design staff is a single designer who can conceive of and execute an idea from start to finish — a straight shot from the right brain to the wrist — maintaining the same coherent creative vision throughout.</description>

      <title>SugarSync Creating and Moving Items</title>

      <description>SugarSync&#39;s web-based document management application allows users to manage files that are kept on their computers. The interactions for creating and moving folders use an identical design pattern for placing items in a directory on the file system. This is similar to the Save As behavior in operating systems such as the Mac Finder and Windows Explorer, which will let users navigate to a disk drive, and then drill down deeply into a directory location.</description>

      <title>SugarSync Uploading Files</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/sugarsync-uploading-files/</guid>
      <description>SugarSync&#39;s upload file behavior uses a customized interface that is not typical. Instead of using the browser behavior for handling file uploads using &amp;lt;input type=&#34;file&#34;&amp;gt;, which typically provides an input and browse button in Firefox and Internet Explorer, SugarSync uses a single button to invoke the file browsing window, and then displays the file&#39;s name in HTML. To be fair, Safari provides a slicker interface for file uploads, which doesn&#39;t display an input, but only a button, and then shows the file name next to the button when a file is found.</description>

      <description>Krolikov is the illustration and animation studio of Russian designer Sedova Elena. Great illustration, and the subtle 3d effect of the boxes adds dimension and interest to the frame surrounding the content. The little touches of animation are brilliant, e.g. the plug in effect on the home link electrical cord and the little motion when mousing over the global nav. I was sort of expecting the little character on top of the books to wink at me or something.</description>

      <description>The Nivea brand advertising site features a very wizard for determining the type of logo file you should download depending on how the logo will be used. The visitor will answer questions about the purpose, application, and size needed. At the end of the process, a file is given to download. The questions are very easy to answer, and stepping the user through this process eliminates having to sift through a longer list of file types to determine the logo that would best suit the user&#39;s application.</description>

      <description>Jakob Nielsen&#39;s latest Alertbox recommends that order of OK vs Cancel should be determined by the standard order defined by the platform&#39;s interface guidelines. Alas, if you&#39;re designing for the web, order becomes problematic because Windows interface guidelines put OK first, whereas Apple guidelines put it last. Nielsen suggests that you base the order on the installed platform of your audience, i.e. if you have predominantly Windows users, you might be best served by putting OK on the left.</description>

      <description>Lou Rosenfeld shares the questions one should pose when engaging prospective consulting firms for information architecture and information management project work. This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you&#39;re a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project.</description>

      <description>TextFlow is a new parallel document editing application and service that allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously. The service should appeal to people who use the Track Changes feature of Microsoft Word. TextFlow lets users edit documents, and instantly see the changes suggested. One person can review the changes and apply them. The difference between this service and something like Google Docs or working in a wiki, is that the changes are indicated visually, rather than having to go through the diff displays in revision history.</description>

1. The home page.2. Clicking, Foodservice, one of the main entry points in the global nav pulls that word out of the nav and re-positions it at the top of the page.3. Following a link to a sub-page, we are now viewing &amp;quot;Foodservice &amp; Kitchen.</description>

      <description>Schmap provides a local guide service for major cities. Listings are provided with general guide information, reviews, photos, and location on a map. The iPhone service attempts to maximize the unique features of that device. Listings are simple lists with thumbnails, but if you rotate the phone to landscape orientation, the listings then display alongside a map with markers to show where each place is located. Rotating back returns to the list view.</description>

      <description>Facebook&#39;s address auto-completion in the compose message form is one of the best examples of auto-completion behavior in a form. The interaction very closely mimics what you would expect to happen in the To field of email applications like Apple Mail and Outlook.
1. Cursor is in the To: field. Contextual help displayed below input.2. Typing characters in the input invokes person/recipient auto-completion suggestions. 3. Selecting a person from auto-completion suggestions, entering a comma, or clicking enter displays the selected recipient in a block.</description>

      <description>Last.fm provides a simple interface for tagging artists or tracks that mimics the email address entry design pattern provided in applications like Apple Mail and Facebook Messaging. Their redesign (beta site accessed May 2008) cleans up their tagging interface by providing auto-completion, and the ability delete tags by clicking the item in the input.
1. Clicking the More menu displays the Add Tags link. Presumably, there will be more than just an add tags item in the future, otherwise Add Tags should simple be visible without this extra link.</description>

The service embeds dynamic links in the page that allow users to preview content from the outside sites in AJAX layers over the page content. Publishers can choose to automatically generate links from certain sites, e.g. YouTube and Wikipedia. They can also create links by selecting text on the page and finding the content they want to embed.</description>

      <description>The stories of Zappos&#39; commitment to superior customer service has become nearly legendary. From regular upgrades to next day delivery at no cost to the story of a customer service reps delivery of flowers to a customer whos mother passed away. Now, in Harvard Business Online, Bill Taylor tells of Zappos&#39; unusual customer training program. Zappos offers new employees a $1000 offer to quit after a 4 week training session. The idea behind this tactic is that by weeding out people who take the offer, they keep the ones who will be committed to the company.</description>

He points out the failing of choice over context in the old paradigm of UI design. Standardization of UI elements (tabs, combo boxes, etc.) was meant as a way to keep users from having to learn how to use an interface.</description>

      <description>There are several applications and web services that help you determine if the colors used in your designs will be accessible to users that cannot view all colors. My personal favorite is the Sim Daltonism app for the Mac (pictured above).  Sim Daltonism is a color blindness simulator for Mac OS X. It filters in real-time the area around the mouse pointer and displays the result — as seen by a color blind person — in a floating palette.</description>

It works on three principles: first, that anyone who wants to can have their vote counted; second, that things people find interesting are more important than people who find things interesting; and third, that by any means necessary, web-strategy, social-media, online-marketing webcocks – unaware as they are of how toxic their presence is in the arenas they cannot shut up about – must and shall be filtered out of view.</description>

The global navigation persists in a fixed position in the left of the page, and clicking on any of these links scrolls the user to that area of the page. You can just as easily scroll with the scroll bar as well. In some areas, you can pan horizontally, e.g. to see more images in the portfolio of work.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just coming across the idea of hashtags for creating groupings on Twitter after seeing them in factoryjoe&amp;rsquo;s tweets and following a link from merylkevans to the page Twitter Fan Wiki on hashtags. This is a great example of how new uses of an application emerge can be defined by users.
Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They&amp;rsquo;re like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post.</description>

      <description>Noah Brier&amp;rsquo;s celeb tags and brand tags sites is a crowdsourced tagging game that asks participants to tag a brand or celebrity and then see how others have tagged the brand or celeb. The game can be played in reverse as well, by viewing a tag cloud and trying to guess what the brand or celeb is.
I tried to take screenshots, but the celebrities&amp;rsquo; tag results were full of nonsensical tags.</description>

      <description>Fi, the Stockholm/New York City agency that was formerly known as Fantasy Interactive built up its history by making glossy flash sites where nearly every element on the screen moved and had audio attached to it. The agency has matured over the years and uses Flash more selectively and strategically now, and the name change is meant to reflect that maturity. The founder talks about usability as the thing that will characterize Fi in the future, and their clean site update reflects that.</description>

      <description>TwittEarth is another spinning earth globe interface for displaying geolocalized information that&#39;s similar to the Yahoo Newsglobe and wii news channel interfaces. I don&#39;t care much for viewing the public twitter feed, so it&#39;s not very interesting to me. I&#39;m still trying to imagine the context that makes these interfaces practical for everyday use. The place where it makes most sense to me is in the 10 foot experience, as with the wii news channel.</description>

      <title>Zebra Striping: Does it Really Help?</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/zebra-striping-does-it-really-help/</guid>
      <description>The conclusions in this A List Apart article about zebra striping, the method of using alternating row colors in tables, strike me as odd. My first reaction to the article was, &amp;ldquo;Why do you need to study the usability of that technique?&amp;rdquo; I wonder if the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t so much a question of usability, but rather of aesthetic sensibility. Bad table row style without zebra striping can adversely affect readability as much as good zebra striping or horizontal rule style.</description>

Forms make or break the most crucial online interactions: checkout (commerce), registration (community), data input (participation and sharing), and any task requiring information entry. In Web Form Design, Luke Wroblewski draws on original research, his considerable experience at Yahoo! and eBay, and the perspectives of many of the field&#39;s leading designers to show you everything you need to know about designing effective and engaging Web forms.</description>

      <description>Chuck Green offers some advice to designers who see a lot of uniformity in look and feel or sameness of style in their graphic design projects. His point is that design is not artistic expression and that designers need to be able to focus their work on solving problems rather than merely layering their point of view and style over their solution. He argues that the ability to devise different approaches to different problems is difficult, but that designers should attempt this while keeping their opinions at bay.</description>

      <description>Mike Padilla offers up a description of facets and their use on web sites for browsing and filtering. He defines the types of interactions or behaviors that are typically found on sites with faceted browsing, describes what happens in terms of the system when you apply filters, and shows some examples of faceted browsing in use on sites including my favorite, Nike.com.

      <description>nForm&amp;rsquo;s user experience cards describe UX tools, methods, and approaches. These are illustrated descriptions of what the term is and why you would use it. The trading card metaphor just means that they the descriptions are pithy. Leave them on your conference table for customers to skim while you&amp;rsquo;re getting them coffee.

      <description>I use different screen capture utilities depending on the type of screen I&amp;rsquo;m trying to grab. Some are great for a quick and dirty capture of a page I want to send someone. Others are good for annotating an interface I want to post to a web page. And still others are best for archival screen capture or for interfaces with video. Below are the 6 screenshot utilities that Mac users should know about.</description>

      <description>Nokia are beggining a co-creative film project about music that will call for the contribution of film clips taken with mobile phones. The site resembles most video portals, Each video page includes a video player, sharing tools, favoriting and tagging. Finally Jumpcut&amp;rsquo;s video editing/mixing tool is provided when you click the &amp;ldquo;Remix Movie&amp;rdquo; link. This allows you to reorder clips and apply effects and transitions.

      <description>drewish.com provides a nice script that takes a base font and line height and generates a scale of font classes with font sizes, line height, and margins calculated as ems. It&#39;s an odd selection of scale however with fonts sized at 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 px. You can easily set this to a more familiar 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36px. Or following Mark Boulton&#39;s lead, you can set to 11, 13, 16, 18, 24px.</description>

      <description>Stephen Celis&#39; Timeframe javascript library allows you to create a calendar that allows users to select date-ranges by first clicking a start or end date, and then clicking the other end of the range. The range is shown as you expect in desktop calendar applications with a filled bar between the dates. Hover over the range and click the X control to delete. Nice.

      <description>The Multiple IE Installer is a must have resource for front end developers. I had to configure a new computer for myself because of a recent job change, so that meant installing all of my design/development tools again. On my new MacBook Pro, I run VMWare and just ran Tredosoft&amp;rsquo;s Multiple IE Installer for Windows XP. On an XP machine with IE7 (you must upgrade to IE7 before running this), the application will allow you to select versions of IE 3, 4, 5, and 6 to install.</description>

      <description>readbag is one of those incredibly simple and well-implemented services that puts a subtle but useful twist on a product in an already crowded space. The readbag bookmarking service (it&amp;rsquo;s actually a Google App Engine application) provides the functionality to do one thing very well&amp;ndash;bookmark pages that you want to read for later.
Now you might argue that you can use any social bookmarking service to do this, or something like Evernote.</description>

I wonder about the freshness of these results though, and I think the scale of the bars is a little off. :)

      <description>Cartoon Network are building a new online gaming community that hopes to challenge the model of the Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) with FusionFall, a game that leverages a community of players, but doesn&#39;t require the long term buildup of skillsets and earned resources. We&#39;re not building a game for hardcore gamers who will spend 60-plus hours a week here. If you think of those as hour-long dramas on TV, we want to be the half-hour sitcom.</description>

      <description>Facebook is tapping its international user community to help translate it&#39;s interface, namely the copy for its guidelines, into nearly the 2 dozen languages that represent the community&#39;s market outside the US. The localization effort is a massive crowdsourcing task that has been both criticized and lauded. The critics often point to the unpredictability and inconsistency of translations. Proponents of the effort applaud the boldness at utilizing an already eager community to contribute to making the application better for users in other non English-speaking countries.</description>

      <description>Pattern Tap, an interface and visual design gallery, provides a UI for filtering using tags. Best case scenario would get rid of the filter button and also updates the set of available tags to indicate those that can be combined with the current selection (e.g. dim or hide tags that can&#39;t be combined with my selection &#34;black AND white&#34; AND simiple.&#34; Often times in interfaces that provide filtering based on all available tags or index terms, if the filtering UI doesn&#39;t update to reflect those terms that may successfully combined, the user is led down a path to an empty set.</description>

      <description>In my old days working on a corporate portal, I occasionally had to take someone&amp;rsquo;s HTML, which was generated by Microsoft Word, and drop it into an entry on a CMS. But before I could just cut and paste, I had to run a series of regular expression replacements in vi or Allaire HomeSite to strip out any of the god awful HTML that Word generated. To pay homage to the past, fate recently dropped a Word HTML file in my lap.</description>

      <title>Bill Buxton on Innovation and the Long Nose Theory</title>

      <description>Bolt|Peters summarizes Bill Buxton&amp;rsquo;s talk at CHI 2008, which is focussed largely around his theory of long nose. The article in BusinessWeek describes the danger of trying to innovate around the long tail theory alone, and attempts to create awareness for this other phenomenon which he calls the long nose. The theory describes how the bulk of innovation is low-amplitude and takes place over a long period of time. [T]he bulk of innovation behind the latest &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; moment (multi-touch on the iPhone, for example) is also low-amplitude and takes place over a long period—but well before the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; idea has become generally known, much less reached the tipping point.</description>

      <description>This set of 113 free 10x10px grayscale mini icons from Brand Spanking New is a nice set of small, unobtrusive icons that can function inline with text or in places where smaller type might be used, e.g. with metadata. This is not a new set of icons, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to start collecting examples of icons here.

      <description>The REC movie site is one of the most immersive Flash video interactive pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a long time. The site puts you into the movie as though you are watching video captured from an observer who is actually in the scene. There&amp;rsquo;s a qality to the video and the storytelling here that feels very reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project, and here it is an equally successful vehicle. After exploring and experiencing some of the terror for a few minutes, check out the video footage of audience reactions at a screening of the film.</description>

Facets include useful filtering criteria such as job title, salary range estimate, company, location, and job type. Filters beneath any facet may be selected at any point while viewing the results, and removed in an ad-hoc manner regardless of the order selected. Users may also remove all filtering to return to original results.

      <description>Paidcontent reports on a study conducted by MarketingSherpa on advertising bechmarks, which showed the effect of online ad placement in relation to the fold.
According to the report, most individuals don‘t see most ads served to them—especially ads served below the fold. Despite this result, media delivery reports rarely include information on whether, or what percentage of, a media buy was served above or below the fold. On the chart below, the bottom of the blue area represents the percent of total viewers who see an ad; the top represents the percent of total viewers who scroll to a point where the ad is visible on their screen.</description>

      <description>Represent Recruitment is a boutique career placement agency in London, UK serving professionals in creative design industries. The recruiter&amp;rsquo;s site is a nicely implemented minimalist site that presents information with little fanfare. Navigation is very shallow, making content easy to traverse. One thing I think would work to this site&amp;rsquo;s benefit is to move the job listings up in the hierarchy of pages and offer email notifications or RSS feeds of new jobs.</description>

      <description>Adobe TV is a video on demand portal for information about Adobe products, including instructional videos and behind-the-scenes tours. The portal sports a dark color palette and subtle beveled edges, keeping consistent with the look and feel of applications like Lightroom and the various Labs projects, and giving the site the appearance of expensive audio/video componentry in a pro rack. The site is very simply organized, with only a handful or channels.</description>

The categories carry over in the search results page, which displays your results in collapsible sets, much as you would see with the Mac OS Spotlight search. Some result sets are even rendered as a carousel (look at iTunes results).

Peter Denning and Peter Yaholkovsky break down the tools needed for various knowledge needs into four categories: 1) Information sharing; 2) Coordination; 3) Cooperation; and Collaboration.
 The article apparently discusses the misunderstanding of the term collaboration, and when it is an appropriate practice.</description>

      <description>Flickr have announced that they are now letting Pro account users post video up to 90 seconds to their accounts. An invitation only group called Video! Video! Video! was created to showcase some of this new content. I&amp;rsquo;d love to post small videos to my Flickr account. I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved that my digital cameras limit me to capturing only the short moments. In a way, it reminds me of haiku, in that is forced to create poetry within the constraints and rules of the format.</description>

      <description>I absolutely love the idea The Superest, a game/blog that features drawings of superheroes. The Superest is a continually running game of My Team, Your Team. The rules are simple:
Player 1 draws a character with a power. Player 2 then draws a character whose power cancels the power of that previous character. Repeat.
 To experience the fun in order, start at the first hero.

Their portfolio is a nice demonstration of the the Flash Papervision tools. Selecting a project presents a stack of media that are unshuffled and spread around the screen, much as you would spread a set of slides on a lightbox.</description>

      <description>Lithoglyph’s Mondrianum is a plug-in that enables Mac applications use color palettes created by the kuler community. Mondrianum acts like a built-in, system-wide color picker, available in any application that supports this feature, including iWork, iLife, OmniGraffle Photoshop, Illustrator, Coda.
Thanks to Andrew for the tip!

      <title>The Fine Art of Wireframes</title>

      <description>On the Geniant blog, T.Scott Stromberg exposes his craft of wireframe sketching. I also spend most of my ideation time sketching. It&#39;s lovely to see other people&#39;s methods for getting ideas down. I love Stromberg&#39;s comments and comic book style.
This might sound kind of pathetic, but seeing the pens and paper he uses is the kind of thing I really geek out on. I love that he&#39;s pimping out the Behance dot grid pads.</description>

      <description>Capzles, a photo management and sharing services uses animated text in a Flash captcha to trick the robots. This is the most sophisticated attempt I&#39;ve seen to make captchas unreadable. It still can&#39;t beat the spam sweatshops, but it seems to me like a very good option for defeating OCR.

      <description>When it comes to researching user&#39;s screen resolution, I&#39;m a strong believer that vertical positioning matters most when considering key issues such as location of identifying elements like site name and h1-type headings, and elements that satisfy business rules such as ad location. The B&amp;amp;A article, &#34;Blasting the Myth of the Fold&#34; addresses this issue well, and I&#39;m in agreement that &#34;the fold&#34; matters little if the above issues are dealt with.</description>

      <description>Sorry for the lull in activity this past few weeks. I&#39;m doing my last days at my current job and getting ready to transition to a new gig in a week.
After the last 2 months with this site, I&#39;ve assessed some of the functionality I went out with, and am doing some cleanup. I launched with all the blades out and am now pulling them back in to only expose the essentials.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve added screenshots to the feeds finally. This has been on my to do list, but I finally got off my ass and spent a couple hours this morning figuring how to get Drupal to do it after a user made some demands. There are a bunch of things that aren&#39;t working for me on this site that I plan to fix, but I went with the idea of getting things up fast versus getting them out right.</description>

      <description>I updated the OmniGraffle Web Design Template.
This web design template is for people who do wireframes and storyboards. The template was created for OmniGraffle Professional provides the basic layout for a design deliverable including the following master canvases: document title, section title, wireframe (portrait and landscape), storyboard, and blank. The wireframes were created at 950px wide with guides following the Blueprint CSS Grid system. Wireframes also have 2 small hairline marks around the 600px point to mark the approximate fold.</description>

      <description>Modernista delivers one of the most unexpected agency portfolios by using UGC tools to display their content. Their site is sort of an un-site. Once you arrive at their domain, a smallish red navigation widget that&amp;rsquo;s 50px x 80px displays in the upper left of the screen. The rest of the screen is taken over by an 100% x 100% iframe showing their Wikipedia page.
For the most part, the red widget is the only bit of the Modernista identity you see in their experience.</description>

      <description>Luke Wroblewski summarizes the fundamental principles that guide Google in designing user experiences, as told by John Wiley in a WritersUA presentation.
 Useful: focus on people -their lives, their work, their dreams. Fast: every millisecond counts Simple: simplicity is powerful. Engaging: engage beginners and attract experts. Innovative: dare to be innovative. Universal: design for the world. Profitable: plan for today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s business. Beautiful: delight the eye without distracting the mind.</description>

      <description>The Economist reports on some research undertaken by Fang Wu and Bernardo Huberman, a pair of researchers at Hewlett-Packard&amp;rsquo;s laboratory in Palo Alto, California, to compare two strategies used on news sites: one based on the previous popularity of a story, the other on its novelty. The researchers based their study on analysis of articles posted to digg, and the article provides some insight into the digg algorithm and the half-life of an entry (about 69 minutes before an entry gets demoted from the home page).</description>

      <title>Publicis &amp; Hal Riney Webcam Gesture Navigation</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/publicis-hal-riney-webcam-gesture-navigation/</guid>
      <description>The Publicis and Hal Riney site attempts to innovate navigation by replacing mouse input by detecting gestures the user makes against their webcam. Once the Flash file embeds your webcam video into the lower right corner of the page, a body outline is superimposed, and hot spots in the North-South-East-West quandrants are ghosted on the screen to show where you should hold or swipe your hand to navigate. Unfortunately the video ended up eating up resources on my machine to the point that the load times were painfully slow.</description>

      <description>Searchme provides a search interface that provides screenshots of search results. The user interface is a flash application that mimics Apple&#39;s new coverflow display in the Leopard finder. The search options provide category filters, and relevant categories are displayed once you&#39;ve typed search terms that match a category. The example here shows categories that are relevant to the search for &#34;new york city.&#34;
Search results provide more information about the site when the user hovers over the screenshot.</description>

      <description>Michael Lopp, Senior Engineering Manager at Apple discussed Apple&#39;s design process at a presentation given at SXSW. Business Week summarized the points, excerpted below.  Pixel Perfect Mockups
This, Lopp admitted, causes a huge amount of work and takes an enormous amount of time. But, he added, “it removes all ambiguity.” That might add time up front, but it removes the need to correct mistakes later on.

      <description>The International Herald Tribune site has, in my opinion, been the site that set the bar for clean, minimalist newspaper web sites since John Weir worked on the design circa 2000/2001. The evolution of the site has continued to stick to Weir&#39;s minimalist visual style, although his innovative DHTML column and clipping behaviors are gone.
The top stories content module is an interface element that is a common feature in news sites.</description>

      <title>Templates for Creating Blueprint-Compatible Comps</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/templates-creating-blueprint-compatible-comps/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/templates-creating-blueprint-compatible-comps/</guid>
      <description>I&#39;ve created Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator templates for creating comps that work with Olav Bjorkoy&#39;s Blueprint CSS Framework. The templates are simply documents with guides based on the 24 units provided by Blueprint. The background image of the grid is also provided with a layer to show unit numbers if you like, and the Illustrator document shows a fake comp to demonstrate positioning on the grid.
You may download the templates here:</description>

      <description>Hulu provides an interesting carousel for the promotion of content on their home page. They use a large stage that spans the entire width of the browser window and shows one promoted piece of content at a time. Left/Right arrows allow the user to page through the promos, and a representation of the promos as mini-screens (small multiples) at the bottom of the stage allows the user to see what number they&#39;re looking at, among the total promos.</description>

      <description>So it&#39;s about 1 month after I officially launched this site. If you were with me when it first went up, you may have noticed a few minor changes. I started out getting as many things up as I could, and am now evaluating the effectivenes of some decisions and simplifying. Some of the issues around changes have to do with figuring out what works best, others are based on issues having to do with services.</description>

      <description>You rarely see radial menus implemented on the web. Radial menus provide a branching interface from a single starting point. Songza uses this interface convention to provide a very interesting way of selecting from 4 categories of actions that can be performed on a single song: play, share, rate, playlist. These are categories of actions you typically get with audio and video media on web sites. The radial menu allows the designer to keep the display simple, so the user can focus on the lists of titles.</description>

      <description>People&amp;rsquo;s Choice for Feb. 2008
Hossli.com is the portfolio of Swiss journalist Peter Hossli, featuring the published articles, a weblog, and photo journal pieces by the writer. The site, designed by Swiss/American designer Tina Roth Eisenberg, presents an ultra clean and modern face to the articles. A simple navigation system for browsing the extensive archive stories by facets including category, type, year, language.

      <description>Pixelmind is the portfolio Li Chin, a Malysian web designer residing in Sweden. She emphasizes that she likes to create clean, simple designs with easy navigation. That ability is clearly evidenced in this site, which is one of the most refreshing portfolio designs I&amp;rsquo;ve come across in some time. The sketches of Li in various poses, including holding a placard of the local navigation, and in the treatment of the site title, global navigation and buttons really give the site personality, without being too cutesy.</description>

The service allows you simply plug an RSS feed url into your account settings for a new site, and delivers a mobile formatted version of that feed. They also provide the ability to publish as an iPhone app, using the IUI interface, which you can experience on Google and FaceBook mobile sites. The service also allows you to create static pages, and customize the colors of the UI.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of zoomable user interfaces. When they&amp;rsquo;re done simply and elegantly, the experience of navigating through a ZUI site is sheer pleasure. You never lose a sense of where you are, and the whole of the site is near by. On small, manageable sites where the number of sections is not very wide or deep, the zooming paradigm works very well. Danka Studio, which creates sophisticated, interactive navigation on its Flash sites has achieved that with the site created for French architecture firm B-CUBE.</description>

      <description>This is perhaps more about information architecture than interface or interaction design. One thing I like about Digg&#39;s About section is the transparency of the company that&#39;s suggested here. They only provide email addresses for contacting the company, rather than providing a form. They provide 4 types of contact: feedback, abuse, press, and partners, each type of gets sent to an email address. This exposes you, the sender, as it doesn&#39;t allow the sending of anonymous email, and gives them a way to respond to you.</description>

      <description>Daylife provides an excellent mechanism for favoriting. The news portal, which is published to demonstrate the company&#39;s news delivery product, provides a simple method for saving favorites that uses a star icon. The site classifies articles into topics which are simply terms describing a subject matter, person, or company/organization. Users see star icons when they hover over a link to a topic or a story. Starring the link adds the topic or story to their &#34;</description>

      <description>I prefer not to use dummy text, because creating wireframes and comps that reflect how they will really look and function is what people pay me for, and is a sign of a lazy IA/IXD. Plus it can be really enjoyable to write real fake copy. Having said that, I have to admit to being the lazy IA from time to timeand have gone to gone to lipsum.com to generate dummy text.</description>

      <title>Samsung TouchWiz &amp; F480 (Phone Scoop)</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/samsung-touchwiz-f480-phone-scoop/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/samsung-touchwiz-f480-phone-scoop/</guid>
      <description>PhoneScoop provides a demonstration and photos of the new Samsung TouchWiz finger touch user interface, a 2.0 version of the company&amp;rsquo;s Croix OS. This one of the first phones to rush to market in order to compete with the iPhone. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be a multi-touch-type interface for two-finger interactions like zooming, but dragging and dropping appears very similar to the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s drag behavior. One of the fun features is a very configurable home page, which provides user-selectable widgets.</description>

      <description>TechSmith has published a useful tutorial that shows how to view where people clicked during sessions. Morae recordings use TechSmith’s Rich Recording Technology (RRT) to capture video, audio, camera input, as well as all sorts of data, including keyboard entry, screen text, web page changes, mouse clicks, and system events. Use Manager’s Search Results pane to help you focus in on this valuable information to support your findings.
 This feature is pretty hidden, so Morae users will want to check this out.</description>

      <description>Denis Kortunov provides a nice illustrated list of common mistakes in icon design.
 Insufficient differentiation between icons Too many elements in one icon Unnecessary elements Lack of unity of style within a set of icons Unnecessary perspective and shadows in small icons Overly original metaphors National or social characteristics not being taken into account Images of real interface elements in icons Text inside icons Outside the pixel framework</description>

      <description>Gawker Media&#39;s weblogs provide a simple method for including YouTube videos in comments. The example shown here is from the Consumerist blog. Users find a video in YouTube, copy and paste the permalink URL into their comment on the blog, and the video is embedded into their published comment. This method of transcluding content is popular in wikis, but the implementation usually involves using a special syntax. Gawker&#39;s method of using translating the permalink is dead simple.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve started experimenting with doing video screencasts in the interface section. You can see an example of the first one here: Gawker Media Video Comments. Scroll to the bottom of the screenshots for video--which we&#39;re going to use Vimeo&#39;s excellent video publishing service for the hosting. Here&#39;s a preview of the first video:
Gawker Video Commenting from jibbajabba on Vimeo.  I think it makes a lot of sense to do this for interfaces because screenshots simply cannot reproduce the experience of transitions, motion, and AJAX interactions.</description>

      <description>Apple TV owners got a software update pushed to their boxes this week, and Gizmodo has a review of the software complete with screenshots and a description of the rental and purchase services now offered. I was a bit disappointed by the update at first, but like my 6 year old son said on the second day, &#34;I&#39;m getting used to it.&#34; Gone is the simple, single panel with left/right hierarchical navigation.</description>

      <title>Newsweek Top 10 Module</title>

      <description>Newsweek uses Clearspring&#39;s Flash widgets to display top read and emailed stories as a content delivery module in a sidebar. This module is like most top story modules provided on news sites, e.g. NY Times, but the interesting features are the ability to adjust the range of stories by time (notice the nice slider control) and to embed the module as a widget. While this module is implemented as Flash, there is no reason it can&#39;t be done as XHTML and Javascript.</description>

      <title>Yahoo! NewsGlobe vs. Wii News Channel</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/yahoo-newsglobe-vs-wii-news-channel/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/yahoo-newsglobe-vs-wii-news-channel/</guid>
      <description>Yahoo! launched the News Globe, which shows the top news stories of the day using a rotatable globe for navigation. The stories are depicted as red blocks stacked over geographic regions of the globe, with taller stacks indicating more stories. By default the interface will autoplay through the top stories, spinning the globe to get from story to story. Clicking a link to a news article jetisons you out of this otherworldly view of earth, and into text land on a separate page.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/iminlikewithyou-comments/</guid>
      <description>i&#39;minlikewithyou&#39;s full Flash interface pushes the boundaries of what can be done with user interfaces in terms of social interaction. The comment feature on the site&#39;s news articles and videos allows users to place comments (including a drawing) over the media. In the case of video, the comments appear briefly on top of the video at the points where people have placed them. Because of the volume of commenting on these videos, tons of comments will roll by in a frenzied flash, so it&#39;s hard to read them all.</description>

      <description>HUGE is a design agency specializing in websites, software applications, and branding. Their site has a modern, minimalist feel. The large bold type, their similarly selective use of large photography, and the subtle hints at the grid, lend an obvious sense of hierarchy and a clear message about what this agency is about&amp;#8212;crisp messaging and confident design. As I look at this mosaic of screens, there&amp;rsquo;s something about the openness, colors, and clear separation of large and small that is light, feels asymmetrically bold, and gives me a generally good feeling.</description>

      <description>The Scholz &amp;amp; Volkmer designed flash site for Leica is a beautiful product showcase with large, sumptuous photographs by Carli Hermes that tell stories, little vignettes really, as seen through the eyes of several Leica toting characters. The direction of the vignettes is flawless, at times feeling like documentary footage, complete with Ken Burns effect panning of photographs. But something magically surreal happens when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the still photography&amp;ndash;elements of the background, including clouds, falling leaves, and waves of water move.</description>

      <description>Maybe.For.You is an interactive agency in Atlanta, Georgia, that works on design for web, mobile, and desktop applications. The maybe site is clean, with a clear sense of order and solidity. Something about the dark, serious colors, the grid lines, and the tone of their messaging gives me the sense that this company takes their work very seriously, and that they&amp;rsquo;re adept at the business side of things.</description>

      <description>AppleInsider discovers an August 2006 patent filing by Apple for features having to do with broadcast video sent over Apple TV. The patent discusses interesting ideas for widgets that overlay the screen to allow such display of information as data related to what is on, and interactions such as purchasing tickets to performances, and doing video chat.

      <description>Apple Insider reports that Apple will ship Safari 3.1 with downloadable web fonts, HTML5&amp;rsquo;s SQL storage application programming interface, and HTML5 video and audio tags. They provide the following description of these new features.
For example, CSS Transforms and CSS Animations will join web downloadable fonts in allowing Safari 3.1 and iPhone users to render web pages and web apps with enhanced design messages and real-time visual effects. By applying Transforms, developers can author trigger actions that scale, rotate, skew and translate HTML boxes in real time.</description>

      <description>Motionbox provides a nice interface for creating clips of videos they host. Along with Hulu, Motionbox is among the first to introduce the idea of clipping portions of web video. However, Motionbox outshines Hulu in terms of usability. Clipping is a simple operation that mimics the video selection paradigm users have become comfortable with on video editing software. And unlike Hulu, Motionbox provides instant feedback about where the start and end markers lie, by moving the video playhead with the position of the markers as you adjust the clip size.</description>

      <description>Radar&#39;s comment feature allows users to post a public comment on a person&#39;s photo, or post a special comment called a whisper that only the owner will see. The owner may click the small X icons next to the comments to delete. The whisper feature is a nice idea, and the execution is dead simple. Allowing comments when viewing a set of photos in list view is very thoughtful and feels right, since these are small-sized cell phone pictures.</description>

      <description>With a tagline like &amp;ldquo;for beautiful people,&amp;rdquo; your web site better beautiful too. Drykorn totally delivers on that promise. There are very few sites I gush over, but every time I come back to this site I want to just wrap myself up in it. Each season the design takes on a new texture, in line with the colors and fabrics of their garments. The design showcased here is for Spring/Summer &amp;lsquo;08, and its appropriately light, but summery fabric background is still as rich and textured as the dark woolen background they sported in the Winter look.</description>

      <description>One of the things I like most about this web design shop&amp;rsquo;s site is the conversational tone of the site. The navigation, for instance describes the site under Who, What, Where type categories. The copy is clear and assuring. The layout and typography also chunks up the hierarchy of page content well and the layered effect provided by taped on bits of photos and paper is nice tool for directing the eye and connecting segments of copy.</description>

      <description>A friend sent me the link to VoteChooser to remind people before the primary to vote. The site consists of a single page wizard that asks you 10 questions about where you stand on political issues. The results page shows how your position aligns with those of presidential candidates in an attempt to help the undecided discover who might be the best person to vote for.
I hesitated at posting this with my results, because I don&#39;t want to make a political statement, but its useful to see how this simple questionnaire is very effective at helping to do a simple research task like figuring out what candidates stand for.</description>

      <description>Edward Pistachio is a writer pulping fine short stories. Consistent with the lighthearted tone of this site, he provides a contact form that is also all about words. Getting his email address requires solving a few jumbles, and then decoding the address from letters found in the jumbles. Sure it may be frustrating if you can&#39;t figure out the jumbles, and is one of the cleverest ways I&#39;ve ever seen to gain access to a bit of info.</description>

      <description>Edward Tufte posted an essay and video with commentary about the iPhone. Tufte is complimentary, for the most part, about the interface being predominantly free of administrative debris, but makes suggestions for how the iPhone can make better use of its screen resolution. As expected, his argument calls for more data density when possible.
He notes that the iPhone has elegantly removed administrative clutter in many places, using the information as the interface.</description>

      <description>CNET reports on Johnny Chung Lee&amp;rsquo;s interaction experiments with the Wii Remote. Lee, a Phd student at Carnegie Melon, does a quick demo of head tracking for VR displays and multi point interaction using the wii remote. His experiments describe with incredible clarity how the wii remote fundamentally works and how the remote might be exploited to do much more than point at single points on the screen and control them.</description>

      <description>Cameron Moll discusses the issue of staring at a blank canvas in Photoshop, and his approach to overcoming &amp;ldquo;blankcanvasphobia&amp;rdquo; and leaping into the design process.
 Familiarize yourself with how others have solved the same problem you’re solving. Draw from previous work. Sketch it out Begin with a grid Begin in grayscale Start with the &amp;ldquo;core.&amp;rdquo; If nothing sticks, come back later</description>

      <description>John S. Rhodes offers a great reminder in this short article on Apogee of how to focus narrowly on singular goals to increase usability. Key things to remember:

      <description>Kayak provided one of the earliest examples of using AJAX to provide data filtering controls and live refinement or filtering of results. Their slider controls remain one of the best examples of how AJAX can be used to make filtering visual and intuitive. Sliders allow users to narrow down search criteria including flight duration, takeoff/landing time, and price. 1. Default filtering controls.2. Search results page.3. Search results after adjusting search filters.</description>

      <title>Paper Prototyping with Morae</title>

      <description>Userfocus provides some inspiration for capturing paper prototype tests with Morae and a webcam. Their method invovlves positioning the camera over the prototype, connect the cam directly to the PC, viewing the camera live in a video editor, and recording the output of the editor in Morae. This method is ingenious. It gives you all of the agility of doing a paper prototype, with the flexbility and control of using Morae for the observation, note taking, and highlight reel creation.</description>

      <description>Roost is a real estate search engine that provides full MLS listings. Their AJAX search refining filters are very similar to those provided by Kayak&#39;s travel search. The slider controls provide a visual method for narrowing down search criteria and results are updated immediately.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/killing-bad-layout-conventions/</guid>
      <description>Andy Rutledge exposes the flaws of an established design conventions&amp;#8212;the 3 column layout. The layout is typically identified by a wide center column with 2 flanking narrow sidebar, and it can be found on some of the largest and most popular sites, including Amazon.com and Apple.com. Rutledge points out the limitations and inefficiencies of this layout:
 Symmetry is usually detrimental to content hierarchy Symmetry diminishes viewer interest Having 2 sidebars, one on either side, defeats the purpose of sidebar content It requires that site visitors first learn (and perhaps relearn from page to page) where to look for a particular sort of ancillary information or links Often results in far too much ancillary information on the page The particular sort of visual noise generated by the 2 bracketing sidebars diminishes, rather than enhances, user/reader focus on the main content  Rutledge challenges designers to really think about their given problems and design for them; to challenge what has become conventional.</description>

      <description>Moody provides a visual tagging interface for music played on iTunes. A 4 x 4 grid of colored squares provides the clickable UI for describing the mood of music tracks along the vertical axis as calm to intense, and along the horizontal axis as sad to happy. Great concept and quite easy to get after a few tries. With tracks tagged by mood, you can later play them back by selecting clicking the listen tab, and selecting as few or many moods as you would like, and finally click play.</description>

      <description>The Nike Store provides an excellent faceted navigation for narrowing product listings by sensible facets including gender, product type, sport, color, and price. The site skins the faceted classification tool provided by Endeca, which allows the user to select a product attribute of interest under any facet, and continually provides feedback about the attributes in other facets that can be used to narrow your choice of products down. Nike&#39;s Flash-based implementation is appropriate and useful, and ranks among the best examples of faceted navigation you will find on either commercial or academic databases.</description>

      <description>The Library of Congress has maded 2 of its collections of historical photographs available on Flickr. The goal is to get users to tag and comment on the photos, as well as help provide identifying information. It&#39;s very interesting to see such a large and old institution embracing open social collaboration like this. When I was in school, the idea of user supplied freetagging was pretty seen as an edge-case activity even for things like private databases.</description>

      <description>The winners of Specialized&#39;s Innovate or Die Pedal-Powered Machine competition have been selected. The Aquaduct Mobile Filtration Vehicle was invented by five students from California: Adam Mac, Brian Mason, John Lai, Paul Silberschatz, and Eleanor Morgan.
 The Aquaduct transports, filters, and stores water for the developing world. A peristaltic pump attached to the pedal crank draws water from a large tank, through a carbon filter, to a smaller clean tank.</description>

      <description>Ben Shneiderman&#39;s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design are user interface design rules described in Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction. Shneiderman proposed this collection of principles that are derived heuristically from experience and applicable in most interactive systems after being properly refined, extended, and interpreted.
To improve the usability of an application it is important to have a well designed interface and these &#34;Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design&#34;</description>

      <description>I was a bit confused the first time I saw this rating interface, and have to admit that I ignored it for months. The thing that threw me was the multiple checkboxes offered for each value. But I came back and realized that what this was doing was giving you a pre-defined set of tags which it was then using to create a filtering mechanism for the site. I appreciate that.</description>

      <title>23 Actionable Lessons from Eye-Tracking Studies</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/23-actionable-lessons-eye-tracking-studies/</guid>
      <description>Christina Laun summarizes the top lessons to take away from eyetracking studies.
 Text attracts attention before graphics. Initial eye movement focuses on the upper left corner of the page. Users initially look at the top left and upper portion of the page before moving down and to the right. Readers ignore banners. Fancy formatting and fonts are ignored. Show numbers as numerals. Type size influences viewing behavior. Users only look at a sub headline if it interests them.</description>

      <description>Usability blogger, John S. Rhodes writes in Apogee that Direct Marketing and UX are the same, or at least share common goals and methodologies. This quote sums up these parallel ways of thinking and working:
There is a serious emphasis on testing and measurement. Metrics are the law. Success is based on tangible results: number of phone calls, number of and type of brochures requested, number of email address captured, number of comments made, number of web page views and so on.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/tubetorial-form-labels/</guid>
      <description>By flipping the convention of labels on top or to the left of the inputs, Tubetorial provides a nicely aligned solution. We&#39;re accustomed to reading top to bottom and left to right, so it&#39;s a bit strange to have the label and input reversed this way. This works mainly because there are few inputs in a compressed area, but this might not be as efficient on large forms. 1. Comment form input with labels on right http://www.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s interesting placing the label inside the input. The form fields align nicely, but I imagine the alignment of the actual text you enter wouldn&#39;t work as well with multiple inputs. Since there is only one text input here, this works to some degree.
1. Label is shown inside form input http://baekdal.com/web2rss</description>

      <description>YouTube&#39;s exploring functionality in the full-screen video player allows users to directed exploration of related videos.
1) Clicking the explore button in the lower left brings up related videos visualization, which is sort of like a digraph that looks like a constellation of stars. 2) Circles in the center are videos. Hover over one circle expands to show you other videos related to that one, forming a cluster. Click a circle to watch a video.</description>

      <description>This is a blog in search of a purpose.  In life I’m exploring the question, “what matters now?” and this blog will jibe with each change in the journey.
I’ve been starting with a manifesto for myself, based on exploring what matters to me. On a trail run in June these words came to me. I’m considering them my manifesto for the moment.
I move because if I’m standing still, I’m dying.</description>

      <description>iStockPhoto provides an interesting way of mapping keywords or tags to the controlled vocabulary the site uses. This makes a lot of sense in a site that wants people to be able to browse for concepts, themes, and subject matter with a high degree of relevancy. Curiously, they refer to the keywords as tags on the review screen when the term &#34;tag&#34; isn&#39;t used on the site as of this writing.</description>

      <description>Amazon&#39;s login and registration screen is the standard by which other login screens are measured. The simple flow consists of: 1) entering your email address, and 2) entering your password. If you are a new customer, simply select the new customer radio and the follow up screens provide the registration flow.
1. Enter your email address, if you&#39;re not registered, select &amp;quot;New customer,&amp;quot; otherwise log in2. Enter registration info https://amazon.com/gp/sign-in.html</description>

      <description>Starting off from Basecamp&#39;s sign up page, you pick your plan option, then fill out their form. The form is clean and simple. Inputs and labels are aligned well and there is a logical chunking of sections of the form. I like the simple hairlines between chunks in the top area.
One of the nicest things about this entire experience is the starting point where you select your plan. The user may return to this page at any point to upgrade, downgrade or cancel their plan.</description>

      <description>Simple registration form. No captcha in this form, although that could change when they get out of private beta. Having to click the check button seems unnecessary. A javascript check on blur would be better. This form might benefit from a little chunking, e.g. simple hairlines between some fields.  http://hulu.com</description>

      <description>Registration couldn&#39;t be simpler. 3 fields: enter a username and password twice and you&#39;re done. No captchas. Oops, is that screenname unavailable, well let&#39;s get alerted right away before you go on. Nice.
1. Enter username, AJAX error check and suggestions if username unavailable2. Enter password http://photobucket.com/register.php</description>

      <title>Sidebar Creative Contact Form</title>

      <description>The contact page for this design agency features a clever use of an AJAX slider to allow potential clients to for entering their budget in the range of 10K to 500K. Interesting that the slider increments in 25K&#39;s up to 100K, then increments in 100K&#39;s. Once you get them on the phone, I suppose you can give them your real budget. Maybe that helps eliminate small jobs?

      <description>We happened to catch the Yahoo! registration pages when they were being redesigned in 2007. The first version was captured in November 2007 and the second is the prior version. The redesigned version is subtle, but really improves the user&#39;s flow through the form. It compresses the vertical height of the form and uses more conversational labels.

      <description>Nike&amp;rsquo;s Basketball Site follows the glossy cinematic look of the 2007 sites, which feature lots of motion graphics and video, rich photography, and community features. Love the cinematic stage and the lighting effects around the interface.

      <description>Nike&amp;rsquo;s online retail presence is a Flash application that sticks with the glossy stage of the rest of the Nike product sites. The Nike Store provides faceted browsing powered by Endeca on the backend, so the experience of finding the gear particular to your needs is among the best of any online retailer. http://nike.com/index.jhtml#l=nikestore,home&amp;re=US&amp;co=US&amp;la=EN</description>

      <description>Design and technology consultancy with offices in New York and Los Angeles. A very usable Flash experience with simple, but sexy navigation, clean URLs, selectable text and flexible sorting features on list/gallery pages. The 11&amp;frasl;2007 redesign is much bolder than the previous design (the white bg). An instant classic.

      <description>QBN (aka News Today) sports a superb, clean design with a bolder front page. There&amp;rsquo;s minimal use of JavaScript here, but where you see it, it&amp;rsquo;s simple and useful as in the collapsing/expanding left sidebar divs. Be sure to check out the filter page. Easy to sticking around here a while. I miss the &amp;ldquo;News Today&amp;rdquo; welcome sound though&amp;ndash;the only startup sound I&amp;rsquo;ve ever liked on a home page.</description>

      <description>Design agency with offices in VA and NC. Superb interactions to transition from page to page make this site feel like it&amp;rsquo;s done in Flash, but it&amp;rsquo;s all javascript using JQuery. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s mostly all in done in 1 XHTML page with a few AJAX calls for the dynamic stuff like jobs. Lovely colors and art direction make this site feel warm and human.

      <description>Community for showcasing home design, remodeling, and renovation work. Task-oriented navigation, clean lines, nice use of red as an accent color, and the general airiness of the design. I would have liked the layout to be centered in the page.
