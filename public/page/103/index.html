  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/being-without-chasing-grateful-dead-vs-top-40/">Being Without Chasing: The Grateful Dead vs. The Top 40</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Seth Godin's blog entry, &quot;<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/06/the-grateful-dead-and-the-top-40.html">The Grateful Dead and the Top 40</a>,&quot; looks at a band that only ever had 1 &quot;hit record,&quot; but who were very succesful at what they did. They may have not hit the Top 40 more than once, but one thing is true, they knew themselves as artists, and were true to that.</p>
<p>In terms of chart success, Elton John is probably the polar opposite of The Grateful Dead. He's #2 on the list of most hits on the Billboard Top 40. The Grateful Dead and Elton John are very different artists and have sold records to very different audiences. Elton John has a bigger share of the mainstream and the Billboard charts. I would doubt that either of those attributes were ever a goal of the Grateful Dead, yet they commanded a loyal following who connected with them, and got their music to millions of fans through record sales, touring, and the bootlegs.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan, but so many of my friends in college were that I couldn't help but be aware of the phenomenon that is the Dead. Yet to the mainstream pop music listener, they may seem like small potatoes, and I've heard a few people in my time dismiss their music without acknowledging the rarity of their following.</p>
<p>Dismissive criticism was probably a much easier thing to avoid before the Internet. Godin points out that social media today makes it easy to notice the passing mutterings of the critics who aren't clued in to what makes you special in the market. To those finding themselves receiving this kind of attention and wanting to be reactive in order to reach Elton-status, he offers this advice.</p>
<p><blockquote>The next time you have a choice between chasing the charts (whichever charts you keep track of) and doing the work your customers crave, do the work instead.</blockquote></p>
<p>Doing important work on a product that isn't on the charts might be tough. You might be doing work that goes unseen compared to products that are easily noticeable and press-worthy. Every product is going to find a critic. If you're making a product, being Elton-famous shouldn't be your goal. Knowing yourself and your product, and being true to that are better ways of doing something meaningful.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Fred Wilson shares advice from his father on how to take advantage of the human brain's capacity to subconsciously process information for problem solving.</p>
<p><blockquote>He explained that I should start working on a project as soon as it was assigned. An hour or so would do fine, he told me. He told me to come back to the project every day for at least a little bit and make progress on it slowly over time. I asked him why that was better than cramming at the very end (as I was doing during the conversation).</p>
<p>He explained that once your brain starts working on a problem, it doesn't stop. If you get your mind wrapped around a problem with a fair bit of time left to solve it, the brain will solve the problem subconsciously over time and one day you'll sit down to do some more work on it and the answer will be right in front of you.</blockquote></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Miratech observed the difference between reading an article in a newspaper and on an iPad in an eye tracking study. They concluded that readers are more likely to skim over articles on an iPad than in a newspaper.</p>
<p><ul><br />
<li>The type of medium doesn't influence reading time when the text is short (like an article).</li><br />
<li>It is easier to assimilate and retain information read in a newspaper than on an iPad.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>They plan to write up another white paper presenting their results looking at ad visibility.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Huge has announced <a href="http://www.hugeinc.com/news/noticed/huge-launches-ux-school-for-international-design-talent">HUGE UX School</a>, a graduate program for design talent interested in pursuing careers in User Experience.</p>
<p>Ten students, selected from hundreds of international applicants, will join HUGE’s UX team in New York, where they will receive three months of hands-on training and learn the fundamentals of UX design.</p>
<p>HUGE started the school to help prepare design professionals for successful careers in interaction design and to find and cultivate industry talent. Students in this year’s class come from the United States, Korea, Italy, Dominican Republic and Germany and have backgrounds in industrial, graphic, and interactive design as well as architecture and human-computer interaction.</p>

Students will learn the basics of interaction design, from developing user scenarios and wireframes to conducting competitive analyses and user testing, and learn how IDs at HUGE solve problems. Additionally, students will be responsible for executing a full project from brief through to design. Select students will be offered full time positions with HUGE following the completion of the program.</p>
