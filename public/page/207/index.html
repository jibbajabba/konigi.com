  <section class="article-body"><h2 id="toc0">Definition</h2>
<p>Heuristic evaluation is a discount usability engineering method for quick, cheap, and easy evaluation of a user interface design.</p>
<p>The technique developed by Jakob Nielsen is a systematic inspection of a user interface against usability principles. Evaluation involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and judge its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics”) with the goal of find attending to problems as part of an iterative design process.</p>
<p>Source: &quot;<a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/">Heuristic Evaluation</a>.&quot; By Jakob Nielsen. <em>useit</em>.</p>
<h2 id="toc1">Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics</h2>
<p><strong>1. Visibility of system status</strong></p>
<p>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Match between system and the real world</strong></p>
<p>The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</p>
<p><strong>3. User control and freedom</strong></p>
<p>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked &quot;emergency exit&quot; to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</p>
<p><strong>4. Consistency and standards</strong></p>
<p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>
<p><strong>5. Error prevention</strong></p>
<p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</p>
<p><strong>6. Recognition rather than recall</strong></p>
<p>Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong></p>
<p>Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p>
<p><strong>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></p>
<p>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</p>
<p><strong>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</strong></p>
<p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</p>
<p><strong>10. Help and documentation</strong></p>
<p>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</p>

<h2 id="toc2">Extended Heuristic List by OCLC</h2>
<p><strong>11. Affordances</strong></p>
<p>Does the user understand what the text/graphic will do before they activate it?</p>
<p><strong>12. Use chunking</strong></p>
<p>Write material so that documents are short and contain exactly one topic. Do not force the user to access multiple documents to complete a single thought.</p>
<p><strong>13. Provide progressive levels of detail</strong></p>
<p>Organize information hierarchically, with more general information appearing before more specific detail. Encourage the user to delve as deeply as needed, but to stop whenever sufficient information has been received.</p>
<p><strong>14. Don't lie to the user</strong></p>
<p>Eliminate erroneous or misleading links. Do not refer to missing information.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/inside-ideo/">Inside IDEO</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Design Observer <a href="http://designobserver.com/archives/observed.html?id=47147">points to</a> the 1999 ABC Nightline program that took an inside look at IDEO. </p>
<blockquote><p>How does the process of designing a better product work? To show you, Nightline went to Palo Alto, CA to the designers at IDEO, and gave them the toughest problem we could think of. Take something old and familiar like the shopping cart and completely redesign it in just five days.</p>
<p>IDEO's unique brand of brainstorming is called ''Deep Dive,'' a sort of total immersion into the problem at hand. It's one company's secret weapon for innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a great quote in video 2 that I took away with me. "Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the plans of the lone genius." This was a reaction to the question about why a team vote on brainstorming trumps a boss's opinion. There's also the adage, "Fail Often To Succeed Sooner" that's often referenced at IDEO, regarding their prototyping process. It's great to see the process of ideation, refinement, organization and focusing, and prototyping in this video.</p>

<p>User Experience Design in the Agile Software Development method and Agile Process.</p>
<h2 id="toc1">Agile Method</h2>
<p>Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.</p>
<p>Agile methods generally promote a project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices that allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals. Conceptual foundations of this framework are found in modern approaches to operations management and analysis, such as lean manufacturing, soft systems methodology, speech act theory (network of conversations approach), and Six Sigma.</p>
<p>Source: &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Software Development</a>.&quot; <em>Wikipedia</em>.</p>
<h2 id="toc2">Agile Design Process</h2>
<p>Agile design is an interative design process fit into the Agile Design Method. A bit more exploration of this concept is described in James Hobart's article:</p>
<p>We’re faced with shorter timelines, more aggressive development goals, and limited resources to complete our projects. Each project requires a UI design strategy successfully implemented with the other aspects of the project. Agile design addresses these constraints by limiting the level of documentation to a point that works well for the team based on the skill, complexity, and proximity of the team participants. Agile design acknowledges that great user interfaces are an iterative process and require time-tested, user-centered design techniques as a foundation for success.</p>
<p>Agile design is built upon the principles established by a talented team of professionals who wrote a manifesto on agile development to address the needs of the current development environment we all seem to face. We often attempt to layer usability into a fast moving agile development environment where successive iterations of the code base are commonplace.  This approach can backfire if we insist on heavy documentation and human factors studies before getting prototypes in front of users.  On the other hand, just putting a few developers in a room with some end users can often result in a product that works for a subset of users on the team, but not a product that truly delivers the benefits of user-centered design.  This is because specific design decisions need to be validated with actual usability testing to verify how the users behave, rather than relying on what they think they want.</p>
