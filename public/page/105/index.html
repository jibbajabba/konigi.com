  <section class="article-body"><p>Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about <a href="http://www.viget.com/advance/dont-simplify-the-ux-curate/">the role of UX designers as curators of content</a>. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don't come off as content hackers.</p>
<p>I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.</p>
<p>Curation and editing go hand in hand in my mind. It's as much the role of the curator to question the body of content to find the core of the message to deliver, as it is of the editor to guide a writer to find the lede. That could mean eliminating parts that detract from the message or it's delivery, rather than simply combining and compressing a lot into a small space.</p>
<p>Application interfaces provide problems similar to content. When taking in the number of possible use cases and stories that the application can support, a designer provides direction in terms of the delivery of an interface users interact with. On the interface side, it could mean questioning the necessity of the thing you're hiding for progressive disclosure, rather than finding clever ways to hide it in the first place.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <p class="dek">“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on.  But that’s not what it means at all.  It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.  I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done.  Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”</p>
<p>&#8212;Steve Jobs on product development, from "<a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/carminegallo/2011/05/16/steve-jobs-get-rid-of-the-crappy-stuff/">Steve Jobs: Get Rid of the Crappy Stuff</a>" in Forbes.</p>
<p>Gallo exaggerates a little, but I like the point he tries to argue later in the article about focus and reduction. It takes courage to reduce and say no, and that is a big differentiator when it comes to Apple hardware and software. </p>
<p>Apple is the easy example, but for good reason. Many argue that hindsight analysis of Jobs' strategy might be easy, but the company's success in product development continues to provide lessons to learn. </p>
<p>The idea of knowing when to say no seems obvious and is something you might say is always top of mind. But, if you're working on a product, you're likely to be challenged every day with decisions to say yes or no to the possible products you might design, and the features you might build into your products. Every one of these challenges requires courage to say no if the outcome compromises your vision, because in the moment it will seem like the world is begging for you to do it.</p>
<p>I know as a user of different products, I've been vocal about the pet features I've wanted as a "power user" of said products, and bitched when that voice didn't get heard. But I believe that the tech products that I continue to use and that are of value are those that hold onto a clearly defined vision and purpose, and whose features reflect that with selectivity and refusal to deviate from it. More often than not, to me, these products have provided a more focussed experience. </p>

  <section class="article-body">  <p class="dek">Jumping in and immediately starting to build the product, even if it does get completed and ship, is almost guaranteed to produce a mediocre product in which there is little innovation or market differentiation. When you have only one kick at the can, the behaviour of the entire team and process is as predictable as it will be pedestrian.</p>
<p>&#8212;Bill Buxton in <em>Sketching the User Experience</em><br />
Buxton writes in this passage on the impact of iterative sketching on risk, exploration and innovation.</p>

Group brainstorming sticky note boards (storms) can be set up with a background template, e.g. 5 up, SWOT, venn diagrams, etc. You place colored sticky notes with text, organize however you want,  you can add +1 votes using a voting system, and add comments to notes. There's some kind of recomendations feature that will suggest new topics, which I guess might only work well with certain content types.</p>
<p>You can export a report that shows the stickies added and their votes and comments in a nicely laid out PDF or as an Excel doc. You can also export the laid out sticky note workspace as a PDF graphic. An iPhone app gives you mobile access to your storms.</p>
<p>Pretty sweet. Looks like public storms are free for now. I'm liking it.</p>
