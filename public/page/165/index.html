<p>I'm becoming more and more intrigued by the latest offering of inexpensive touch screen PCs like the <a href="http://us.msi.com/msiaio/specs/productslist.aspx?id=1">MSI Wind Top</a> that have been released recently, as well as the rumored Apple Tablet. I'm excited for the penetration of touch interfaces on higher resolution desktop applications, which will start to spread at a much greater rate to a wider audience when we see low cost devices like tablets and touch screen desktops at netbook prices. </p>
<p>The researchers behind BumpTop released a new commercial version of their desktop interface software that shows how Windows users might begin to use their touch screen PCs before Microsoft releases its own touch interface. You may recall the demo of BumpTop for Windows tablets that was initially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWe-TIy2Lbs">demonstrated in 2006</a> and published in Proceedings of CHI 2006. The recently released $29 product for Windows 7 is a desktop overlay that allows users to access, manipulate and filter objects on their desktop using a <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=143055">piles metaphor</a>.</p>
<p>If Apple comes out with a tablet, I'm sure will see a lot of similar interfaces using their dock piles. Watch the video above to see how the app transforms the Windows desktop, or check out the <a href="http://bumptop.com/">BumpTop</a> page for more info. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/links/autodesk-sketchbook-mobile-brings-sketching-iphone/">Autodesk SketchBook Mobile Brings Sketching to iPhone</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><div class="video">
<object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/YwYm5YhA0pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/YwYm5YhA0pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div>
<p>I've had SketchBook Pro for the Mac for a few years now. I bought it before it was acquired by Autodesk from Alias, mostly for art work, but also to experiment with it as a tool for interface sketching. But while I wanted to use it more, I find myself falling back on paper and pencil almost all of the time. Autodesk recently released <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=13872203">iPhone versions of the app</a> (1 version is free, and the full version is $2.99) and I think it might actually be more useful to me than the desktop version.</p>
<p>I've been playing around with the app as a possible tool for user interface sketching, and am impressed with what I could do with the limited canvas of the iPhone. Right now it feels a little limited for my use. But I am more excited at the opportunities this might provide in the future if any of the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5370252/apple-tablet-aiming-to-redefine-newspapers-textbooks-and-magazines">Apple Tablet rumors</a> come true. </p>
<p>Using SketchBook Mobile on the iPhone is pretty tough. You can see in the demo video above that the user is drawing with his fingernails and working zoomed in much of the time, rather than drawing at 100%. Zooming is easy with the pinch gesture, but having to constantly zoom in and out is a little tedious when you need to back up and see the whole of your drawing. Using stubby finger tips is also hard, but you can get around that largely by using a <a href="http://www.google.com/products?hl=en&amp;q=iphone+stylus&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B6_____enUS346US346&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=uQ_GSrzWBY7i8Qb377hG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=product_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4">stylus</a>.</p>
<p>The interface feels exactly like the SketchBook Pro desktop app. The radial menus are easy access, and thoughtful shortcuts for clearing and undo are provided with double clicks. Panning is a 2 finger gesture, and zooming is familiar using the pinch gesture. The iPhone version actually uses the same paint engine as SketchBook Pro, so it uses the same drawing tools, and they feel and look the same. The same interfaces for layers, color picking, and brush creation are also offered. Saving and sharing is also possible, either by saving to your photo library, or exporting as PNG to email.</p>
<p>Where the small iPhone canvas feels restrictive in SketchBook Mobile, I imagine that a 10" touch screen canvas will feel absolutely perfect. I'm currently using a process for recording and reviewing sketches where I sketch in either of my small 8" or 5" notebooks, snap a photo with my iPhone, and then post via email to our company's CMS, where I can annotate and people can review and comment. But I would be more than willing to try to sketch directly in SketchBook and post those drawings rather than having to jump through the hoops I do now, few as they are. </p>
<p>As you can tell, I'm sort of excited by the idea, and I'm feeling like there are enough indicators that the rumors for the Apple Tablet may be justified. Keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/caterina-fake-why-working-hard-overrated/">Caterina Fake on why working hard is overrated</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/001196.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4ac372308eb1f.jpg"/></a></div><p>Caterina Fake, founder of Flickr and Hunch, <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/001196.html">talks about why working hard isn't as important as working on the right things</a>. Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid... "you have to work smarter not harder."</p>
<blockquote><p>Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be. Being able to read what people want. Putting yourself in the right place where information is flowing freely and interesting new juxtapositions can be seen. But you can save yourself a lot of time by working on the right thing. Working hard, even, if that's what you like to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved that paragraph. I also loved the anecdote about Watson and Crick, the scientists who discovered the structure of DNA, and how their discoveries didn't come from hard work, as much as from being in the world thinking, experiencing, allowing ideas to happen. I think there's a valuable nugget in there to product developers about that space that's sometimes needed for creativity that isn't valued enough and understood. </p>
<p>Creating features to compete, building, and accretion without the relentlessness to say no and focus on the right things isn't the path to quality and excellence. The right path in product development is kind of like finding the right path in life. Asking the hard questions about the things that matter and prioritizing effort around those things <em>is</em> hard work. But it's not working hard on the wrong problems, for the sake of working or existing. It's defining what is meaningful and pursuing those thing with fervor. </p>
