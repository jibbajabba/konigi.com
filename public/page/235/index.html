Some of this is common knowledge: make it look good, choose the right level of fidelity, show it in context. Others are maybe not so obviousâ€¦</p></blockquote>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/complete-beginners-guide-information-architecture/">Complete Beginner&#39;s Guide to Information Architecture</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/complete-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt49b6876898194.jpg"/></a></div><p>For those new to Information Architecture and the role of the IA, UX Booth has written an <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/complete-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/">introduction to the field and role</a>, by taking a look at how some noteworthy IAs have defined the discipline, and looking at some of the work that is typical of our craft. </p>
<p>It can be confusing to understand the role of the IA, because in many cases, IA encompasses more than what is defined in this primer. Depending on where you work, especially if you work in smaller teams, the IA role has a tendency to overlap other disciplines and do research, user testing, and interaction design. But UX Booth has provided a somewhat purist definition of the theoretical role which is very helpful. JJ Garret's <em>Elements of the UX</em> provides a good description of where IA fits into the bigger picture and Rosenfeld/Morville's <em>Information Architecture for the WWW</em> or Christina Wodtke's <em>Information Architecture</em> are excellent places to get to know the nitty gritty of IA work.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/konigi-wants-grow/">Konigi Wants to Grow</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>I'm going to be tearing things up a little while Konigi gets a clue about what it is. I started playing with this blog in Nov 07 as a more organized way of doing my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/sets/72157600094498222/">visual design</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/designpatterns/">user interface design</a> sets on Flickr, and think it's still going well. But over time I've found myself drawn to re-blogging and writing the occasional essay, reminding me of my first try at blogging when I did iaslash. And then the old sketchbooks full of ideas that came out of all those great conversations with IAI peeps in Monterrey and my iaslash readers kept returning, and I found myself wanting to find time to work on some micro-projects to build IA/IXD tools.</p>
<p>It's been a little over a year since I started announced Konigi, and it feels like time to take this site a bit more seriously and use it as a platform for other kinds of the learning, sharing, and collection of resources that I've wanted to do for some time. Konigi wants to be better and do more with its life. So I'm going to start with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3344620893/">a few little design tweaks</a> and evolve the site organically as time becomes available to help this baby along. </p>
<p>So what's coming? I have a series of instructional essays that I've outlined and have started writing. I have a wonderful new community project planned that that will be possible through Peldi Guilizzoni, the gracious and talented creator of <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products">Balsamiq</a>. And I'm going to play at opening up the site a little more until stuff gets broken. The Modus Operandi will be to just do stuff rather than doing so much thinking and talking, to do it wrong, to fail, to have people mock me, and be left standing at the end. As always, I plan to give away some stuff, charge a little for other stuff, and push a few smallish projects forward with the help of friends to fill gaps where we need educational/learning resources.</p>
<p>Finally, I personally want to do more and contribute more outside of this community, and I'm hoping to find a way to give away more to people in need. The sale of things on this site has really taken me by surprise and now I want to do something better and more meaningful if I'm in a position to do so. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do, but when the idea begins to take shape I'll let you know what that's all about. </p>
<p>So onward. Grow up little, Konigi. Make something of yourself.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Music community site thesixtyone uses unobtrusive growl-like panels in the bottom right corner of the page for system alerts and messaging. Like growl or iminlikewithyou, these messages appear briefly and fade out. The effect is subtle and might be easily missed, but the addition of an ambient "pop" earcon (alert sound) tells you to look for the message. Nicely done.</p>

<p>Hard to believe that independent music sites continue to find ways to create social experiences around listening to music in the wake of huge, established communities like last.fm scrobbling and one to one experiences like muxtape playlist sharing. thesixtyone brings band and listener contribution together by letting musicians upload music, while listeners surface the tracks that deserve attention. </p>
<p>It's a nice minimal design that focuses on the experience of playing the new and popular music people are listening to and favoriting. A simple filtering mechanism at the left lets you sort by most active, popular, and recently uploaded while the links at the right allows you to limit by genre. The filters work together, so that your activity and genre selection sticks as you modify either one. Very nicely done.</p>
