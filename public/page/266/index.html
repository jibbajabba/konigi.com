  <section class="article-body"><p>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for "fail-safing" that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Poka-yoke</strong> (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means "fail-safing", "Foolproof" or "mistake-proofing" â€” avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation. The concept was formalised, and the term adopted, by Shigeo Shingo as part of the Toyota Production System. Originally described as Baka-yoke, but as this means "fool-proofing" (or "idiot proofing") the name was changed to the milder Poka-yoke.</p>
<p>An example includes 3.5" floppy disk. The top-right corner is shaped in a certain way so that the disk cannot be inserted upside-down. In the manufacturing world an example might be that the jig for holding pieces for processing only allows pieces to be held in one orientation, or has switches on the jig to detect whether a hole has been previously cut or not, or it might count the number of spot welds created to ensure that, say, four have been executed by the operator.</p></blockquote>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3138042543/" title="Cafe Work/Sketch Kit by jibbajabba, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3138042543_c6ea8f8b58.jpg" alt="Cafe Work/Sketch Kit" /></a></div>
<p>I gave my wife my MacBook to upgrade her from her iBook and got myself a netbook for those times when I'm out and need to wait for my son, and for watching Netflix/Hulu/Slingbox in the house. But I'm also finding that the netbook, a <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/notebooks/ideapad/s-series">Lenovo Ideapad S10</a>, is really pretty damned sweet for when I want to head out somewhere and do sketches in a cafe. I use it to post to our Traction server while I'm sketching. I just have to remember to put it aside so I can concentrate on getting the sketches done.</p>
<p>The S10 is small, but it sports a 10 inch screen. The only downside I've experienced so far is that the right shift key is positioned one key to the right, out of the normal positioning. They did this to make room for the directional arrows. I'm a touch typist, so I was afraid this would be a deal breaker. It's been about 4 days since I got it, and I'm quite used to the positioning now. </p>
<p>I spent a lot of time researching the netbook options in the past month and this one was up against the new HP Mini 1000, which got rave reviews, but which has one of those awkward side-positioned trackbpad buttons. After trying the Lenovo at a store, and having great experiences with the solid feel of IBM Ideapads for years as a corporate mucky muck, my decision was easily made. The Lenovo gives me greater hard disk storage options, not like the anemic SSDs. I know the tradeoffs, but I felt the HD options were fast enough. I'm not looking for sexy here, just affordable, light, fast enough, reliable enough (I say enough because it's Windows after all), rugged, and usable. It's got get thrown into a bag when I tool around town and hold up to my abuse.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm really very pleased with it. I's only been 4 days and I've taken it out only once, however, so we'll have to reserve final judgement after a month. It gives me what I need for a limited number of use cases. I won't design on it, but I can do a good deal of reading/writing/media viewing with it. I'm using Google Chrome for web browsing, and for my primary application uses: Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Reader. I'm absolutely loving it, by the way. I can bring my Pentax DS Mobile 600 scanner with me to scan my drawings and upload to our server when I'm out sketching.</p>
<p>That's all for now. If you're interested, you can click the Flickr photo above to see notes for what's inside my kit. Here's the contents:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://alchemygoods.com/haversack.html">Alchemy Goods Haversack</a>, a 6 x 6 x 11 inch shoulder bag made of recycled bicycle inner tubes and a car seat belt. Love this little bag. </p>
<p>2) Notebook cords in a Kensington bag until I can get a strap to wrap them.</p>
<p>3) Glasses in a cheapo case.</p>
<p>4) The Konigi Designer's Notebook prototype, which you should be seeing more of on this site in '09.</p>
<p>5) Konigi wireframe graph paper pad in a vinyl pad holder.</p>
<p>6) Midori Traveler's Notebook with my weekly planner.</p>
<p>7) Lenovo Ideapad S10.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/interfaces/evernote-text-editor-task-creation/">Evernote Text Editor Task Creation</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Evernote, the unique note keeping desktop, mobile, and web-based application allows users to upload notes from images or PDFs or create them right in the software as one would any publishing system. The note creation editor features a simple rich text editor with one feature that is uncommon for web-based editors--a task checkbox. All this does is insert a checkbox wherever the insertion mark (cursor) is located, and while in edit mode, allows you the user to toggle between checked (done) and unchecked (to do). The toggle does not work in view mode, unfortunately. You can then filter notes to show those that contain that contain unfinished, completed, or all tasks.</p>
<p>I really like where Evernote is heading with some of the functionalities they're putting into the editor. They could go a bit further and actually allow link creation between notes and achieving something like a base set of wiki functionality for single users without necessitating forward linking, which is often the biggest cognitive barrier to entry for those new to wikis. The use of tags and notebooks should be enough organizing power for most users.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/happy-holidays-from-konigi.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who took some time out of their busy days to read Konigi this year, to provide their feedback and commentary, to download my tools, to buy notepads, and to help me keep a dialogue going with you, my new and old design and development friends. This has been a very rewarding first year playing with this blog, and I feel light years away from those years spent doing iaslash.</p>
<p>I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. I'll be slowing down quite a bit in the next few weeks to spend time with my family, but will return in the next few months with some improvements and surprises on this site. </p>
<p>-Michael</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mocklinkr.com/">Mocklinkr</a> is another new design mockup review service to hit the web. This one adds a little twist, however, that might be pretty useful. After you upload images of your designs or wireframes, Mocklinkr let's you create clickable sections on the image linking to another image. This let's you do very simple click-through prototypes to change state and navigate between pages. In a way, this seems a bit like the Berkeley GUIR Denim tool, which is sadly no longer available at the GUIR site. </p>
<p>The video above shows how it works. Jump to 0:30 for the demo. The prototyping is not as sophisticated as using standalone wireframing software or something like Balsamiq, but the approach should be very simple and friendly for people who don't want to bother with software. It allows you to use your own images and adds the online annotation and review features. It's nice to have so many different service options these days.</p>
