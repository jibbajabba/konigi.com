  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.smileycat.com/miaow/archives/001561.php"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a096a771aec5.jpg"/></a></div><p>Christian Watson discusses <a href="http://www.smileycat.com/miaow/archives/001561.php">how he uses paper prototypes</a>, showing a photo of a recent project he worked on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than sketch the whole page on a sheet of paper, I prefer to draw out the various components of the page, cut them out, and Blu-Tack them to the paper. This makes it easy to change different elements, switch them around, etc, without having to redraw the whole page each time.</p>
<p>Sketching out and adding individual components in this way enabled me to quickly come up with a general template layout. I then went back to particular features about which I had more concrete ideas and drew them out in more detail.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Another really helpful feature of paper prototypes — as long as you have them visibly attached to your wall — is that you get to look at them every day. I found this to be invaluable for letting the wireframe 'sink in' so that I could view it and review it multiple times a day and make sure that I was happy with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can't agree more about the benefit of having them taped up to the walls too look at every day. I do this with everything and it helps to see things out of the corner of my eye, or from a distance with some regularity. It's a way of "living with" ideas, in order to assess their usefulness over time.</p>
<p>While I was reading this, I ended up searching for photos of my own paper prototypes and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3525416336/">found this photo</a> I took of a paper prototype I worked on a few years ago. I remember also enjoying the act of taping vellum modules to pages and moving them around with teams and test participants. I think it also feels more fun and participative working with disposable ideas that way.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://alternativeto.net/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a083313cd9f9.jpg"/></a></div><p><a href="http://alternativeto.net/">AlternativeTo</a> might be an interesting tool when doing competitive research. The new site describes itself as a a way to find better Windows, Mac, Linux and online applications by submitting the app you want to replace. It's a community site that relies on user submissions, so the number of alternatives is limited in some areas. Having a look at the <a href="http://alternativeto.net/desktop/basecamp/">Basecamp alternatives</a>, for instance, only shows MS Project and the RedMine web app when I looked. But more popular app suggestions are abundant, e.g. alternatives to <a href="http://alternativeto.net/SearchResult.aspx?profile=software&amp;search=word">MS Word</a>. </p>
<p>This could be a good resource with time for collecting examples to reference when doing a competitive study for a web app. One to watch.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/links/flairbuilder-interactive-wireframes-and-software-prototypes/">FlairBuilder: Interactive Wireframes and Software Prototypes</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.flairbuilder.com/">FlairBuilder</a> is a cross-platform tool for rapid authoring of interactive wireframes and software prototypes. It focuses purely on wireframing/prototyping, and provides an experience that looks like it's targeted at apps like Axure, but work will cross-platform because it's built on Adobe AIR.</p>
<div class="screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/flairbuilder-1.png" /></div>
<p>The application provides a page/canvas editor onto which you may drag and drop UI components. Selecting a component provides a properties inspector so that may set dimensions and stylistic properties, text values, and any other available UI options. The event inspector allows you to set events that occur on click, e.g. go to another page, show a window, show card stack, etc.  Master canvases are useful for providing any reusable elements across pages. Elements in the master my have events attached to them, and 1 master may be applied per page.</p>
<div class="screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/flairbuilder-2.png" /></div>
<p>It was easy to drag UI elements into the page and start to add properties and actions to them. The canvas also provides tools for object alignment, ordering, locking, and grouping. I liked the smart guide snapping, but could also use a grid in the canvas. Typography options are limited, but that might be intentional. There were also some minor issues with keyboard use on my Mac, e.g. Delete key didn't appear to work, but it was fully functional otherwise.  </p>
<p>Building up interactions seems the strongest part of the app. Aside from simple actions to switch canvases and show dialogues, the app also allows you to show state changes in the page using card stacks. Do you remember Hypercard? Card stacks are like that. A card stack is a collection of frames or cards that you place into a page, which only displays 1 card at a time. You can put any UI elements into a card, and then create actions to move through the stack. With this simple paradigm you can create state changes within the page. For instance, I quickly mocked up a card for a product that showed a "Product added!" confirmation next to an add to cart button. Very nice.</p>
<p>Another nice touch is that media are also rendered in preview/prototype mode, so Google maps, any embedded videos, and even the webcam viewer will display the playable media or video from your camera if attached.  </p>
<div class="screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/flairbuilder-3.png" /></div>
<p>Switching to preview mode hides the UI Component library, page/master browser, and property/events inspectors and renders the pages with actions enabled. You may enter values into form inputs and textareas, interactive elements such as accordions and tabs are interactive, and any events may be triggered on click. </p>
<p>The first release looks very promising. It will be interesting to see if future releases will allow any functionality outside of the desktop client, e.g. export to a Flash for use on a server.  </p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/business/10ping.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a08334b160c4.jpg"/></a></div><p>The NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/business/10ping.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1242040513-Kke1lvsicTbH8SYjNFYe3w\">interviewed Doug Bowman</a> to talk about his departure from Google, which Bowman wrote about <a href="http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html">on his blog</a> in March. Bowman came onto Google as their first Visual Designer 3 years ago, and left in March. Some quotes from the article:</p>
<p>Bowman on Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Data eventually becomes a crutch for every decision, paralyzing the company and preventing it from making any daring design decisions,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowman on Twitter, where he is now Creative Director:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has also found a new way to listen to customers: reading their tweets in reaction to the new design features.</p>
<p>“Using data is fundamental to what we do,” Mr. Bowman said. “But we take all that with a grain of salt. Anytime you make design changes, the most vocal people are the ones who dislike what you’ve done. We don’t just throw the numbers in a spreadsheet.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Deborah Dunn, associate professor at the Stanford Institute of Design:</p>
<blockquote><p>Adhering too rigidly to a design philosophy guided by “Web analytics,” Ms. Dunn said, “makes it very difficult to take bold leaps.”</p>
<p>“It is more from engaging with users, watching what they do, understanding their pain points, that you get big leaps in design,” Ms. Dunn said.</p></blockquote>
