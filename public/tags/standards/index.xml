      <description>David Travis reports for UserFocus on &#34;ISO 2082, Ease of Operation of Every Day Products.&#34; While web-focussed interaction designers and information architects may not be involved in the design of everyday products, we should probably be interested at a high level, in the processes discussed. As Travis points out, clients are increasingly concerned with objective measurements of usability, and standards such as this &#34;...will help ensure that we have robust and reliable test methods for all interactive designs, whether these are products, software or web sites.</description>
