What I'm proposing is for you to think twice about these ‘rules’ which are preached so often around the web and aim to create something original. Don't live in the old world of pushing all your quality content on the visitor at once because they've only got 4 seconds before their attention drops (or whatever other statistic is doing the rounds at present).</description></item><item><title>ClickTale Scrolling Research Report</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/clicktale-scrolling-research-report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/clicktale-scrolling-research-report/</guid><description>ClickTale makes observations about scrolling based on their research of users' browsing behaviors around "the fold."
