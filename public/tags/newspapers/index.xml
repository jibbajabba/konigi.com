I like the idea of using this as a PDF rather than as a printed newspaper, since I no longer read printed newspapers. I also like the newspaper format, and have been using Tabbloid to peruse my must read daily feeds rather than using my RSS reader lately. I wonder, however, about taking online media and making analog versions of it.</description></item><item><title>Newspaper Website Design</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/newspaper-website-design/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/newspaper-website-design/</guid><description>Smashing Magazine does a newspaper roundup in a week that saw the FT.com make news for its redesign. These days, the design lines between blogs and newspapers are starting to converge a bit with those newspapers that take the threat of the blog format seriously. Smashing Mag does a good design of screenshooting and comparing what news sites are doing. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/11/newspaper-website-design-trends-and-examples/</description></item></channel></rss>
