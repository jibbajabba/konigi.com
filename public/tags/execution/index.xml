      <description>I was chatting with UX friends Matt and Mark when the topic of taste came up. Mark brought up the Ira Glass Storytelling series of videos, which are great. If you haven&#39;t seen it, there&#39;s a great discussion on taste for creators. This is Ira Glass from This American Life talking about story telling, and how we get into creative work because we love it and we have good taste. He talks about the gap in the beginning when we&#39;re trying to make stuff, that turns out short of our expectations.</description>
