      <description>Beatport&#39;s Pro app for the Mac offers a shopping experience that&#39;s tailored for the way DJs shop for music. The app lets users analyze their music (tracks, sounds, and playlists) to prepare sets and add music to their playlists. Here are some of the elements of the version 2 interface related to shopping in the app.
Beatport comes close to the experience of shopping in a record store, breaking down music into genres and sub-genres.</description>

      <description>New York Magazine provides a site search form in the header with options to limit the scope of search, and features advanced filtering options on results page. The results page is simple on the surface, but provides powerful filtering options in the sidebar. The search strategy is shown with actions for removing terms from the search or clear all.
I found some of the behaviors on filtering options to be inconsistent with others.</description>

      <description>The Holland Festival provides a program browser/calendar that provides an AJAX interface for viewing over 3 weeks of events in a grid. Drop down menus are provided to narrow or expand by genre, locale and route. A single toggle highlights featured events. And a sliding selector, which can be dragged to move the range left and right and with handles to narrow or expand the window, allows you to filter the days to be shown in the grid.</description>

      <description>The Washington Post uses a related content widget created by Evri that indexes content using person, place, and thing (subject) facets and allows the Post to display a list of related content beneath news. The widget, which is actually a bit of SVG/VML and JavaScript, provides a small visualization of topics in the article, and allows the user to do some filtering of the related content. Navigating to topic pages provides a complete filtering view for exploring and narrowing related content.</description>

      <description>The Zappos&#39; search engine provides a nice results filtering interfaces that presents the user with facets for refining their search. The user can click on the terms at the top of the search results page to narrow the set, and a breadcrumb trail shows the selections they&#39;ve made. Each term in the breadcrumb provides a checkbox to remove any one of those selections and broaden their search.

      <title>Google Analytics Drop Down Menus</title>

      <description>I&#39;m a fan of the drop down menus that span a wide area, e.g. the main body or full page, in order to show a wider range of options rather showing fewer in a vertical drop down and forcing navigation through a fly-out tree. This convention is showing up mostly in global navigation, and with the introduction of Microsoft&#39;s Ribbon, we can expect to see more of it.
Google shows buttons with down arrows to indicate that clicking one of those controls will show expanded options in-screen, a la the drop down menu.</description>

      <description>Rofo provides a faceted search engine for commercial real estate properties. The beta provides a search interface at the top of the home and results pages to set parameters including location, size, type of space, and budget. Slider controls are used to narrow size and budget. At present, changes in these settings require a manual page submission to update results. The top location shows some limitations on the number of visible values that can be displayed.</description>

      <description>del.icio.us&#39; tag filtering provides an excellent interface design for filtering tags without having to scan your tag list or tag bundles, which can turn out quite long over time. In a control area that looks and behaves like a hybrid breadcrumb trail, you enter a tag into an input. Tag suggestions are provided as you type. Build up that filter by adding tags, and each tag in your crumb path can be removed independent of the path you took by clicking the tag&#39;s adjacent X icon.</description>

      <description>Performancing Metrics is a web analytics product that is focussed on Blog Systems. Their reporting views provide an highly scalable solution for data filtering that takes up very little screen real estate, yet provides a powerful mechanism for adding criteria to do granular reports. This example shows an ad-hoc filtering of the Visitors data on their demo server.
This solution, showing an inline set of filter criteria on a single row contrasts with several typical filtering techniques that can be used.</description>

      <description>Yugo Nakamura and the Simone Inc. crew are serving up some sick Flash once again for Uniqlo. This time, the mini site is devoted to women&amp;rsquo;s bras. The mood is cheerful as happy electronic strings accompany the dizzying array of women&amp;rsquo;s headshots spinning and combining to create patterns in 3D space. Click on a picture to reveal the details (in Japanese) of one of the women&amp;rsquo;s age, height, and bra size, or use the pop up menus to filter the set down.</description>

      <description>Pattern Tap, an interface and visual design gallery, provides a UI for filtering using tags. Best case scenario would get rid of the filter button and also updates the set of available tags to indicate those that can be combined with the current selection (e.g. dim or hide tags that can&#39;t be combined with my selection &#34;black AND white&#34; AND simiple.&#34; Often times in interfaces that provide filtering based on all available tags or index terms, if the filtering UI doesn&#39;t update to reflect those terms that may successfully combined, the user is led down a path to an empty set.</description>

Facets include useful filtering criteria such as job title, salary range estimate, company, location, and job type. Filters beneath any facet may be selected at any point while viewing the results, and removed in an ad-hoc manner regardless of the order selected. Users may also remove all filtering to return to original results.

      <description>Kayak provided one of the earliest examples of using AJAX to provide data filtering controls and live refinement or filtering of results.

      <description>The Nike Store provides an excellent faceted navigation for narrowing product listings by sensible facets including gender, product type, sport, color, and price. The site skins the faceted classification tool provided by Endeca, which allows the user to select a product attribute of interest under any facet, and continually provides feedback about the attributes in other facets that can be used to narrow your choice of products down. Nike&#39;s Flash-based implementation is appropriate and useful, and ranks among the best examples of faceted navigation you will find on either commercial or academic databases.</description>
