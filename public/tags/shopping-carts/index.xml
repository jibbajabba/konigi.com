I like how this implies the forward movement through the checkout process a bit better than the cart workflows that use vertically arranged collapsing panels.
1. Product page.2. After adding product to cart, the cart panel slides in from right, and product panel slides off canvas to left.</description></item><item><title>Panic Shopping Cart</title><link>http://konigi.com/interfaces/panic-shopping-cart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/panic-shopping-cart/</guid><description>Panic, the Mac software company that makes Coda and Transmit, has an apparel store with fun shopping cart behaviors that mimic the Mac's dock. The apparel store shows t-shirt listings, and a little cart dock at the bottom of the page that invites visitors to drag t-shirts down into it to add to cart. Clicking and dragging shows the ghosted t-shirt moving with the cursor until it snaps into the dock.</description></item></channel></rss>
