Curate.</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/don%e2%80%99t-simplify-ux-curate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/don%e2%80%99t-simplify-ux-curate/</guid><description>Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about the role of UX designers as curators of content. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don't come off as content hackers.
I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.</description></item><item><title>The more you know, the less you need.</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/more-you-know-less-you-need/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/more-you-know-less-you-need/</guid><description>“The more you know, the less you need. The experienced fly fisherman with only one rod, one type of fly, and one type of line will always outfish the duffer with an entire quiver of gear and flies. I never forget Thoreau's advice: 'I say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes...'"

Below is her summary of what dogs can teach us about interaction design.
1. It's important to know who is in charge. Just like training a pet, a designer need to establish a rapport with clients that mixes trust and expertise.</description></item><item><title>The iPad is a Toy</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-toy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-toy/</guid><description>"Apple said Monday that it sold more than 300,000 iPads on the day of its launch, ushering in a new era of people buying things to find out what they are." -- Seth Meyer for Weekend Update on SNL.
I knew that it would be much more like an iPod Touch than a Mac netbook. But what I didn't know until I "found out what it really was,"</description></item><item><title>To Change Effectively, Change Just One Thing</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/change-effectively-change-just-one-thing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/change-effectively-change-just-one-thing/</guid><description>Peter Bregman writes about how finding the simplest solution provides the most effective path to change. In his story he talks about how changing one thing, one habit or pattern of behavior, permitted him to be effective at losing weight. This simple strategy contrasts with the multitude of diet books that suggest entire regimine of change in order to lose weight.
It's a great tale that Bregman uses to illustrate how simplifying a process or dealing with a challenge can sometimes be most effectively handled by reducing it to its essence, and devoting 100% of energy on a singular action.</description></item><item><title>John Maeda on Simplicity at Apple, and the Future of Design</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/john-maeda-simplicity-apple-and-future-design/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/john-maeda-simplicity-apple-and-future-design/</guid><description>John Maeda wrote a short article for Huffington Post about simplicity and humanizing design, what it has meant for the software developed on Apple products, and what it means for the future. The respect so many designers have for Apple is possibly bourne out of reverence for the philosophies that lead to reduction, simplicity, and the humanizing of user interfaces. Maeda talks about Jonathan Ive in this regard, citing his ability to make something real and human by getting his hands dirty.</description></item><item><title>Barry Schwartz on the Paradox of Choice</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/barry-schwartz-paradox-choice/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/barry-schwartz-paradox-choice/</guid><description>Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz's estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.
The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren't perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way.</description></item><item><title>readbag personal bookmarking</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/readbag-personal-bookmarking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/readbag-personal-bookmarking/</guid><description>readbag is one of those incredibly simple and well-implemented services that puts a subtle but useful twist on a product in an already crowded space. The readbag bookmarking service (it's actually a Google App Engine application) provides the functionality to do one thing very well--bookmark pages that you want to read for later.
Now you might argue that you can use any social bookmarking service to do this, or something like Evernote.</description></item></channel></rss>
