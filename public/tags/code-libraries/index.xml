It feels very close to writing natural language statements, in a format that is a bit more familiar in code than writing sentences. A simple example contains IF, ON, DO, and TO pairs and would look like this: &amp;lt;input id="name" type="text" data-anijs="if: focus, do: wobble, to: p"</description></item><item><title>uilang</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/uilang/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/uilang/</guid><description>uilang is a minimal, ui-focused programming language for web designers that handles click events, primarily for toggling classes and css display properties. I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on ".try-it" toggles class "hidden" on ".info-box"&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that's a plus if you don't want or need someone else's implementation of those things.</description></item><item><title>Semantic UI Library</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/semantic-ui-library/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/semantic-ui-library/</guid><description>Semantic UI is a framework for building HTML sites that aims at creating a system based on semantic naming and sensible defaults.
The framework compares itself directly with Bootstrap. It uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements. Interface definitions are tag ambivalent so you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element.

There are several techniques for placing labels inside the input box. For varying reasons we may want to avoid the label on top or side positioning, but as Jackson points out, the infield placement can be problematic. Part 1 talks about the problems using infield labels. Part 2 shows how they deal with the problem by using a visible tooltip that doesn't obscure the input, with a jsFiddle snippet to play with the code.</description></item><item><title>MiniAjax: Rich UI Showcase</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/miniajax-rich-ui-showcase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/miniajax-rich-ui-showcase/</guid><description>MiniAjax is a nice showcase of javascript libraries for rich interaction behaviors.

The range is shown as you expect in desktop calendar applications with a filled bar between the dates. Hover over the range and click the X control to delete. Nice.
