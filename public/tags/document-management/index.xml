I've had to use different tools like Source Safe, Sharepoint, Basecamp, and just shared drives to this. One nice thing I like about working with our Traction server is that it does Webdav for document management and file versioning. That's one of the projects I'm working on a preview release of to make the web-based interface a bit more friendly.</description></item></channel></rss>
