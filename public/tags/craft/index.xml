      <description>I got around to watching David Gelb&amp;rsquo;s documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi after seeing it making the rounds on the web repeatedly. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a documentary kick lately, and this has made it into the category of films I&amp;rsquo;d re-watch. The film looks at the life of celebrated sushi chef, Jiro Ono, whose small restaurant serves only sushi and requires a reservation 3 months in advance, and who is regarded as the most masterful sushi chef in Japan.</description>

      <description>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. He went to art school.</description>

      <title>UP THERE and Appreciation of Craft</title>

      <description>With the glut of anti-craft sentiment I hear and read so often, I think it fitting to post an entry about the love of one&#39;s work, drawing from a craft outside of our own.
UP THERE is a beautiful documentary about the slow, laborious, and fading craft of hand-painted advertising murals. This is the NY I love. This is the type of appreciation of craft that I admire.
 I feel like the humble young man towards the end that looks at it this way.</description>

      <title>Design, the web, and craft</title>

      <description>I&#39;m a little late on getting to this one, but wanted to post before I forgot because it is a great topic for early and mid-career web designers. Matt (emenel) reacted to Mark Boulton&#39;s thoughts about whether or not designers needed to know html.
Matt summarizes what he believes:
As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making.</description>

      <title>13 Creative</title>

      <description>I like the trompe l&amp;rsquo;oeil look of this paper product designer&amp;rsquo;s portfolio, designed by Deluge Studios. It&amp;rsquo;s like sneaking in and taking a snapshot of the sumptuous printed goodies on her desk while she&amp;rsquo;s not looking. The multi-column text blocks on the notepad are nice (click the About page to see that), the colors are rich and elegant, and the decorative flourishes are lovely.

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s excellent Creative Mornings on physical computing, Zach Klein and Casey Pugh from Vimeo talked about tinkering with Arduino, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. They showed some simple circuit controls using the LEDs and Processing, and then demoed a Daft Punk helmet they created with LEDs, that could then be controlled/drawn on via a Flash UI. Neat stuff. Later, I got to talk to Carl, a freelance developer/interaction designer who turned me onto NYC Resistor.</description>
