      <description>So it&#39;s my birthday today. One thing that I&#39;ve learned about birthdays from having a child, is that it&#39;s a lot of fun to give gifts away on your birthday. I&#39;m now a seasoned goodie bag shopper and can tell you some interesting places to go in Manhattan and Brooklyn to find unusual gifts for boys age 8-10. But since I can&#39;t give all of you rare swag from Tokyo Toy, I thought I&#39;d offer up a template that freelancers might find useful.</description>
