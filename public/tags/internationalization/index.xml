      <description>Facebook is tapping its international user community to help translate it&#39;s interface, namely the copy for its guidelines, into nearly the 2 dozen languages that represent the community&#39;s market outside the US. The localization effort is a massive crowdsourcing task that has been both criticized and lauded. The critics often point to the unpredictability and inconsistency of translations. Proponents of the effort applaud the boldness at utilizing an already eager community to contribute to making the application better for users in other non English-speaking countries.</description>
