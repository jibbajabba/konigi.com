      <title>5.25 Inch Floppy Sketchbook Is Back</title>

      <description>Remember these? From 2009-2010 I these sketchbooks for a while, using a 5.25&amp;rdquo; floppy disk as a notebook cover. I kind of missed them, so I made a limited number in blank and grid paper.
Itâ€™s a wirebound 5.25 inch square sketchbook with about 120-130 pages (60-65 sheets) of 70 pound white vellum paper, hand-crafted by me in my home North of the SF Bay. You can buy a book with blank sheets or one printed with 1cm grid in warm gray ink.</description>

      <title>Wireframe Icons Update v. 1.5 for OmniGraffle and EPS Versions</title>

      <description>The OmniGraffle Wireframe Icons and the Royalty Free EPS/PNG icons have been updated.
In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I&#39;ve cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description>

      <description>An Extended License Agreement option has been added for use on commercial web sites and web apps. The Standard Royalty Free (RF) License allows for use on commercial web sites and print collateral. Purchase with this option if you plan to use the icons in Wireframes, personal, private use, and use on commercial sites. This license does not cover commercial web services and apps that utilize the icons.
The Extended Royalty Free (ERF) License permits use on commercial web apps and services.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/wireframe-icons-royalty-free-eps-and-png/</guid>
      <description>Based on demand to use the wireframe icons on web sites, and to use them in Adobe Illustrator and Visio, I&amp;rsquo;ve created EPS and PNG versions that include a Royalty Free license agreement. You may use them in your UX documents, but the license also permits you to use them in web sites. There are restrictions for use on commercial products or commercial applications that offer products
or services for sale or for fee-based usage, however.</description>

      <title>Sketchbook In Stock (Set 2)</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/sketchbook-stock-set-2/</guid>
      <description>The sketchbooks are back in stock. In this round, I&#39;ve also made a handful with white elastic bands, which I think looks pretty cool contrasting against the black covers. I&#39;ve also started including a barebones option without elastic, inner pocket, or pencil. The standard option is $16 and the barebones option is $2 less. The standard option is hand-crafted by me here in Brooklyn, so they&#39;ll sell out faster than the barebones options.</description>

      <title>OmniGraffle Sketch Stencils Now Available</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-sketch-stencils-now-available/</link>

      <description>Sketches are often better tools for communicating designs than high fidelity illustrations or schematics. The purpose of the sketch style wireframe is to prevent the intended audience from thinking about visual design and focus on the functionality and behavior you are proposing.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of this set of sketch stencils for OmniGraffle, based on the Wireframe Stencil. This set of user interface sketch stencils is designed for OmniGraffle 5.</description>

      <description>The Konigi OmniGraffle Wireframe Icon Set is a set of grayscale cursors and icons that come in handy when designing wireframes, aka user interface schematics.

This set of icons is designed to work well with your wireframe stencils. You&amp;rsquo;ll find rich text editor controls, file system actions, social interaction symbols, ratings and voting, and a host of other icons for most of the behaviors you may want to communicate with an icon.</description>
