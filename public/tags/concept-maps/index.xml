      <description>Hugh Dubberly of ddo does some nice concept maps, poster-sized infographics to model ideas. Their description:
We create concept maps, a type of model, to explore and learn about complex information spaces. By showing everything—the forest and the trees—in a single view, concept maps help people create mental models and clarify thoughts. We create concept maps to share understanding—with our clients, peers, and others interested in the subjects.
 Their gallery of downloadable PDF posters include the creative process, play, innovation, and much more.</description>
