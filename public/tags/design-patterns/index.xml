Johannes wrote his Thesis on &amp;quot;Transitions in the User Interface,&amp;quot; in which he analyzed how motion in the user interface can be a helpful extension to static elements to enhance the user experience.
The collection of transitions is clustered into 6 different categories: Orientation, Spatial Extension, Awaking Controls (Awakening?), Highlight, Feedback, and Feedforward.</description></item><item><title>Android Interaction Design Patterns</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/android-interaction-design-patterns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/android-interaction-design-patterns/</guid><description>Android Patterns is a community-contributed site with interaction patterns for Android app design.

I've spent a little time looking through the interaction design category, and there's a lot of great examples there, and most importantly they've done the work of organizing and describing each problem/solution thoroughly. Check it out.

Deconstruct the user flow of web sites, illustrate the flow with annotated screenshot flowcharts, allow users to copy the flow and reuse on the site. Like Konigi, this does a great job of capturing examples of alternative approaches to interaction, showcases them for you to compare, and allows you to select the best examples to learn from and inform you of approaches you may not have thought of.</description></item><item><title>Design patterns (User experience design resources)</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/design-patterns-user-experience-design-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/design-patterns-user-experience-design-resources/</guid><description>Dey Alexander Consulting's site includes a lengthy bibiliography of articles, discussions, and links to resources on user interface design patterns.
