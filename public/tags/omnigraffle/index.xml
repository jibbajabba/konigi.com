The character replacement one in particular will save you time. Although I tend to just clone an entire object's style the style brush with W and OPT+W, you should definitely learn about cloning discrete styles with chicklets. You'll wonder you never did.

Added iPad Portrait 1 up, iPad Portrait 2 up, iPad Landscape 1 up. They have guides for 2x2 or 3x3 grid.
Note, this is for OmniGraffle Pro ONLY. You will not be able to edit shared layers to modify the headers and other templates.</description></item><item><title>Omnigraffle Sitemap Generator from Sitemap XML</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/omnigraffle-sitemap-generator-sitemap-xml/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/omnigraffle-sitemap-generator-sitemap-xml/</guid><description>Wireframes Mag pointed to an XML to OmniGraffle Sitmap Generator created by Jason Kunesh at Fuzzy Math to generate a sitemap from an XML file. The script assumes that your XML file consists of url elements, and that parent child relationships are defined by the paths in the url. For instance, //konigi.com/about-site/unicorns would be a child of //konigi.com/about-site. Once you generate a list of your urls and pass it to the script, OmniGraffle generates the sitemap hierarchy for you.</description></item><item><title>How to Make Tree Components in OmniGraffle</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/how-make-tree-components-omnigraffle/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/how-make-tree-components-omnigraffle/</guid><description>I swear I've answered this question a dozen times, so I'm capturing to refer people in the future. The tree control in my OmnGraffle Wireframe Stencil is a godawful hack that uses tabs and arrow characters. Copying and pasting the arrows, however, screws up the formatting. OmniGraffle just doesn't make this kind of manipulation of text all that easy and I haven't found an ideal solution, but if you want to learn how I do it, read on.</description></item><item><title>OmniGraffle for iPad Video</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-ipad-video/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-ipad-video/</guid><description>The OmniGroup now has video up of the OmniGraffle for iPad showing what looks to be an awesome product.

The stencil, for now, is targeted at developers familiar with the default characteristics of views and controls provided by UIKit. The stencil shapes are all vector based. The initial focus is on views and controls provided by UIKit and recommended application styles as discussed in the iPhone and iPad Human Interface Guidelines.

In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I've cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description></item><item><title>960 grid template for OmniGraffle</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/960-grid-template-omnigraffle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/960-grid-template-omnigraffle/</guid><description>Iâ€™m a big fan of increasing efficiency and consistency from conceptual design to implementation.
