      <description>The Heads of State are a 2 person design studio in Brooklyn and Seattle. Their recently redesigned site showcases the strong portfolio of print work on projects including book covers, magazine illustrations, and corporate identity. I love the simple, powerful covers on the Rosenfeld Media books, and after diving into their site, I think I&#39;d love even more to hire them in the future.
