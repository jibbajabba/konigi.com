The page format is similar to popurls, and is intended for people who are too busy to set themselves up with their own RSS reader, or just fancy a quick glance at the latest UX news. The page is curated by Harry Brignull, creator of 90 percent of everything. Feeds are refreshed once every 24 hours.

But now that I've tried it, I have to say that I'm pretty happy with the idea of having this pushed to me for those times when I'd rather read blog updates without my Google Reader. Tablloid turns your feeds into a cleanly designed personal magazine, and delivers a PDF to you, with links intact, at an interval you set.</description></item></channel></rss>
