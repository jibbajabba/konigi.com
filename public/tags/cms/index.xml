The note creation editor features a simple rich text editor with one feature that is uncommon for web-based editors--a task checkbox. All this does is insert a checkbox wherever the insertion mark (cursor) is located, and while in edit mode, allows you the user to toggle between checked (done) and unchecked (to do).</description></item><item><title>WordPress Layout Customization</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/wordpress-layout-customization/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/wordpress-layout-customization/</guid><description>WordPress added some excellent layout customization options on administration screens in version 2.7. The most obvious change comes in the form of the Screen Options tab, which expands a settings panel that let's the admin hide or show parts of the UI being viewed, and saves those settings for the user immediately. The UI also provides a drag and drop behavior to re-arrange modules. When hovering over a module heading, the icon turns into a full hand and lets the user move modules up or down in the column, or between columns.</description></item><item><title>AIGA CMS Administration</title><link>https://konigi.com/designs/aiga-cms-administration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/designs/aiga-cms-administration/</guid><description>The redesign of the AIGA content management system by Happy Cog and Naz Hamid is easily one of the nicest looking CMS admin experiences I've ever seen screen shots of. Neutral background colors are easy on the eyes. There's great attention being paid to the details. Icons are well designed and clear, forms are laid out well, everything is perfectly aligned, and page elements direct the user through every facet of administration.</description></item><item><title>OnSugar Site Publishing</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/onsugar-site-publishing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/onsugar-site-publishing/</guid><description>Sugar Inc. releases the OnSugar Blogging platform to let Sugar community members start their own sites. Based on the Drupal platform, OnSugar provides some very nice modifications to clean up and simplify the posting and content management interfaces provided by the popular open source CMS. What I like most about what they've done with Drupal is the clean tabbed UI for content creation, the media embedding options for inserting images from Getty, ShopStyle, and Fashion week photos, and the excellent spread editor.</description></item><item><title>Yammer Microblogging</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/yammer-microblogging/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/yammer-microblogging/</guid><description>Yammer is a Twitter clone for companies.

Blogger and Pages use beveled buttons rather than using the more minimalist style of the borderless icons in Gmail. One might argue that these controls are actually more usable because the states of toggles and the affordances supplied by buttons and dropped down menus should be obvious.</description></item><item><title>Google Sites Rich Text Editor</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/google-sites-rich-text-editor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/google-sites-rich-text-editor/</guid><description>Google Sites, the new wiki application that is now part of Google Apps is a content management tool based on the JotSpot service acquired by Google. Sites retains the excellent rich text editor tools that JotSpot had. The formatting bar allows users to do the simple things you would expect from a word processor, such as making font changes and adding styles such as headings to text, insert lists, links, images, and table of contents.</description></item><item><title>Traffik CMS</title><link>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/traffik-cms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/traffik-cms/</guid><description>http://www.playintraffik.com/Home</description></item></channel></rss>
