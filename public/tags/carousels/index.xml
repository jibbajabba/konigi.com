The most common method for paging through a series of items is to show a carousel on the main pages, with prev/next arrow icons to shuffle through sets of 3-4. On special featured modules with larger poster image thumbnails they use coverflow with their hybrid scrollbar which has arrows that increment one item at a time, or allow you to scroll to move through larger increments.</description></item><item><title>MSNBC Spectra Visual Newsreader Carousel</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/msnbc-spectra-visual-newsreader-carousel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/msnbc-spectra-visual-newsreader-carousel/</guid><description>MSNBC.com's Spectra Visual Newsreader provides an interesting way of visually presenting channels of content from the massive news site.
