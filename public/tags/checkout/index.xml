      <description>I finally made some time to read through Luke Wroblewski&amp;rsquo;s excellent review of the changes in the Apple store&amp;rsquo;s redesigned checkout form. According to Wroblewski, &amp;quot;&amp;hellip;retail sales data shows that Mac sales were up 21% year-over-year in the months of October and November. So it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that Apple&amp;rsquo;s primary online sales channel (Web-based checkout) was redesigned during this time.
I wasn&#39;t surprised that the single page checkout form is an improvement over the paged version.</description>
