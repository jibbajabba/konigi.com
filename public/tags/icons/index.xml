      <description>The OmniGraffle Wireframe Icons and the Royalty Free EPS/PNG icons have been updated.
In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I&#39;ve cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description>

      <description>Realmac Software is the maker of LittleSnapper and RapidWeaver apps for the Macintosh. Their site sports the kind of clean rounded corners and beveled edges we come to associate with Apple, but brings in a more colorful and rich palette with excellent illustrations and product icons throughout. Glassy reflective marquees melt into the 2 column product info below, and big icons and buttons make clear targets for calls to action.</description>
