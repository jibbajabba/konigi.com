The course, Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design, is designed for those new to Balsamiq, but also features some demonstration of new features like Quick Draw (using the mouse to block out wireframe zones) and Alternates (creating alternate versions of screens). If you&amp;rsquo;re a veteran user, you may be interested in checking that out, and updating to the latest version to take advantage of these useful new ways of working on projects.</description></item><item><title>Creating Polished Wireframes in Balsamiq</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/creating-polished-wireframes-balsamiq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/creating-polished-wireframes-balsamiq/</guid><description>For Balsamiq users or anyone that bemoans handwritten fonts and sketchy wireframes, I wrote an article to show how to create polished wireframes in Balsamiq on our UX blog. It shows how to use the wireframe skin with a few base controls, and techniques to achieve a minimalist aesthetic. It&amp;rsquo;s meant for those who need to create client-ready deliverables, or for when the sketchy-skin gets in the way of communicating your ideas.</description></item><item><title>Experimenting with the IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/experimenting-ipevo-interactive-whiteboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/experimenting-ipevo-interactive-whiteboard/</guid><description>I got an IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard System ($149 retail price) to demo and did a first little experiment. The product consists of a video sensor and interactive pen. You have to have a projector as well. Here's a super rough demo I made for my team at Balsamiq to show how it would work using Balsamiq Mockups.
While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it's pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you're so inclined.</description></item><item><title>User Inter Faces: Avatars for mockups</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/user-inter-faces-avatars-mockups/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/user-inter-faces-avatars-mockups/</guid><description>UI Faces is a useful little tool by Caleb Ogden for generating a grid of avatars that you can use in your designs.

Main difference between Redacted and BLOKK (which the font is copies/is inspired by) is that Redacted uses smaller widths so your text blocks won't end up wider than your normal font setting.
Git it for free.

The two groups have been working together to integrate Mockups into the UX StackExchange. You can now post Mockups wireframes with questions and answers to UX.StackExchange.com using the free integrated Mockups editor. I'm really excited about this. One of the conversations Peldi and I had before I joined Balsamiq was about creating something I've wanted to use for a long time--a site where you could upload wireframes to vet ideas, get feedback, and test concepts with other peer professionals.</description></item><item><title>Steedicons</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/steedicons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/steedicons/</guid><description>The Steedicons set by Kyle Steed contains 300+ hand drawn icons available as a font or in vector format (.ai, .eps, .csh) for Illustrator, Photoshop, or the wireframing tool of your choice.
