      <description>I published a free course for Balsamiq users on Skillshare. The course, Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design, is designed for those new to Balsamiq, but also features some demonstration of new features like Quick Draw (using the mouse to block out wireframe zones) and Alternates (creating alternate versions of screens). If you&amp;rsquo;re a veteran user, you may be interested in checking that out, and updating to the latest version to take advantage of these useful new ways of working on projects.</description>

      <title>Creating Polished Wireframes in Balsamiq</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/creating-polished-wireframes-balsamiq/</guid>
      <description>For Balsamiq users or anyone that bemoans handwritten fonts and sketchy wireframes, I wrote an article to show how to create polished wireframes in Balsamiq on our UX blog. It shows how to use the wireframe skin with a few base controls, and techniques to achieve a minimalist aesthetic. It&amp;rsquo;s meant for those who need to create client-ready deliverables, or for when the sketchy-skin gets in the way of communicating your ideas.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with the IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard</title>

      <description>I got an IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard System ($149 retail price) to demo and did a first little experiment. The product consists of a video sensor and interactive pen. You have to have a projector as well. Here&#39;s a super rough demo I made for my team at Balsamiq to show how it would work using Balsamiq Mockups.
 While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it&#39;s pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you&#39;re so inclined.</description>

      <description>Christian Naths&amp;rsquo; Redacted is a set of fonts released under SIL Open Font license with block and scribbled font faces. Main difference between Redacted and BLOKK (which the font is copies/is inspired by) is that Redacted uses smaller widths so your text blocks won&amp;rsquo;t end up wider than your normal font setting.
Git it for free.

      <description>protomoto is an excellent showcase of prototyping or wireframing tools created to helps designers find a tool that&amp;rsquo;s suited to the specific devices or platforms they are designing for. The site, developed by Paper &amp;amp; Equator, will be adding more filters in the future as they continue to evolve the resource, so that you can browse the tools based on features. Very cool.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited about the announcement we at Balsamiq were able to make jointly with the group at StackExchange today. The two groups have been working together to integrate Mockups into the UX StackExchange. You can now post Mockups wireframes with questions and answers to UX.StackExchange.com using the free integrated Mockups editor. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this. One of the conversations Peldi and I had before I joined Balsamiq was about creating something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to use for a long time&amp;ndash;a site where you could upload wireframes to vet ideas, get feedback, and test concepts with other peer professionals.</description>

      <description>All the OmniGraffle users out there will want to check out Todd Moy&amp;rsquo;s list of tips and tricks that all OG power users need to know. The character replacement one in particular will save you time. Although I tend to just clone an entire object&amp;rsquo;s style the style brush with W and OPT+W, you should definitely learn about cloning discrete styles with chicklets. You&amp;rsquo;ll wonder you never did.

Added iPad Portrait 1 up, iPad Portrait 2 up, iPad Landscape 1 up. They have guides for 2x2 or 3x3 grid.
Note, this is for OmniGraffle Pro ONLY. You will not be able to edit shared layers to modify the headers and other templates.</description>

      <description>Click the full screen icon, it&amp;rsquo;s much better that way. Headphones warning: rowdy party music ahead.
I rarely do click-through prototypes, but if I have to, then I use Symbols and links in Mockups to make it painless. This is a speed-wireframing video I whipped up to demonstrate to customers in a few minutes what the experience of wireframing with Symbols is like.

      <description>Sketching interfaces is a path focussed on generating many ideas and finding the right design. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to adapt the activity of physically sketching on paper to get the same results in Mockups. On the Balsamiq UX blog, I wrote about a technique I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with to do sketchboards in Mockups using a Symbols library. http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2011/04/28/sketching-in-mockups/</description>

      <description>Don&#39;t let anyone tell you that the tools you choose are wrong or inappropriate. Find the right design and keep winning.
Occasionally I&#39;m asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I&#39;m familiar with.</description>

      <description>Wirify is a bookmarklet that lets you turn any web page into a wireframe in one click. Similar to the Web Without Words, it converts all of the elements on a web page to gray boxes, so you can visualize the page as a schematic without content.  This reminds me of a a technique used in painting and design where one steps back a distance from the canvas or screen and blurs the eyes to get a view of the placement of parts of the design, the relationship of the parts to each other, the white space, and the hierarchy of elements.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve release Mockups 2.0 at Balsamiq. The main feature in this release is the Symbols functionality. It allows you to reuse groups of controls in order to create templates, page masters, and libraries of re-usable components. This can be done globally for all of your projects, or locally within a single project. You can create symbols from the top down and the bottom up. There&amp;rsquo;s some documentation for this somewhat advanced feature here: Working with Symbols.</description>

      <description>Sarah Sampsel wrote about designing the Washington Post iPad app, in 2 entries describing a little bit about the process. The first entry describes the types of interaction, visual design, and brand issues she had to consider when designing for the device. The second shows a few wireframes of the evolution of the home screen design.
Would have been lovely to also see some of the sketches, but it&#39;s awesome that Sarah shared not just final wireframes, but a series of wireframes showing the iterations.</description>

      <description>Touch Notation is a simple annotation system created by Matt Gemmell for documenting multi-touch gestures. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly simple system when compared to the more literal annotation symbols that use hands, because the symbology can be quickly rendered in sketches as well as being used in wireframing libraries.
The Touch Notation page provides PSD, AI, and OmniGraffle templates. I&#39;ve additionally created a Balsamiq Mockups version of the system on Mockups To Go.</description>

      <description>Mike Lohrman&amp;rsquo;s Wireframe Showcase is a user-contributed wireframe and UI sketch gallery. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping, since there is some space on the individual pages for content, that we&amp;rsquo;ll see a little more discussion about process and design thinking here rather than mere visuals of design artifacts. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see more people showing how they explore ideas with sketches and wireframes.

      <title>Shades of Grey: Wireframes as Thinking Device</title>

      <description>Will Evans writes for UX Mag about his process for creating wireframes, or more precisely how he uses wireframes for ideation and problem solving. Will breaks his design process into three phases: divergence, transformation, and convergence.
This seems similar to a common theme I come across when designers talk about their process&amp;ndash;framing/ideating, reframing/ideating, selection/refining. Buxton also refers to this, citing Stuart Pugh&amp;rsquo;s idea by illustrating the expanding/contracting nature of a designer&amp;rsquo;s concept selection, which I find easy to map to sketching-&amp;gt;wireframing as well.</description>

      <title>A wireframe kit for Google Drawings</title>

      <description>Morten Just created wireframe templates using the new drawing tools available for Google Docs. The illustration tools in Docs gives you basic shapes you need to create UI elements that can be combined and grouped to create components. The biggest advantage is that since it&amp;rsquo;s document authoring in the Docs cloud, you can do collaborative editing.
For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t think this is ideal, but it is interesting because of the online collaboration.</description>

      <description>If I were an Axure user, this is what I would be using. Version 2 of Loren Baxter&amp;rsquo;s of the Better Defaults library has been expanded to sixty five (or so) interactive and cleanly styled widgets. Use it in place of the standard widget set.

      <description>I wanted to capture all of the slides and videos into one entry to compare each of the guys&amp;rsquo; approaches. The right way? There isn&amp;rsquo;t one right way. That&amp;rsquo;s the point. The one thread that does carry through, however, is a general process of discovery/research, sketching/ideation, selection/refinement, visual design. Will Evans

      <description>An iPhone OS OmniGraffle stencil for designing applications for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices. The stencil, for now, is targeted at developers familiar with the default characteristics of views and controls provided by UIKit. The stencil shapes are all vector based. The initial focus is on views and controls provided by UIKit and recommended application styles as discussed in the iPhone and iPad Human Interface Guidelines.

      <description>Will Evans shows us how he sketches and wireframes interfaces in this cool video, which is a nice preview of what you may see in his upcoming talk on &amp;ldquo;The Right Way to Wireframe&amp;rdquo; at IXD10. Incidentally, he&amp;rsquo;s using OmniGraffle with our free wireframe stencils. Will says this about wireframing:
Increasingly, as designers of interactive systems (spaces, processes and products for people), we find ourselves stretching the limits of communication tools to explore and document what it will be like to interact with the things we design.</description>

Lorem Ipsum, wireframes, personas, etc are just tactics. The only thing that matters is: Do people love what you built?
Amen, brother. Here&#39;s 1 cent... I agree with Karen about Lorem Ipsum.

      <description>Waiting for your thumbnail&amp;hellip;
This is an interesting looking tool that lets you create HTML wireframes using a web interface. You specify your grid, then insert one of the pre-defined UI components into the page. An inspector lets you modify the component attributes. There isn&amp;rsquo;t any information about who is responsible for this tool and if it&amp;rsquo;s merely an experiment or a demo of something we can expect to see in an application or framework.</description>

      <description>The OmniGraffle Wireframe Icons and the Royalty Free EPS/PNG icons have been updated.
In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I&#39;ve cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description>

      <description>This is a demo of an HTML Prototyping Toolkit that I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled from a few open source libraries. The idea is to create something super light so you can sketch your wireframes in HTML.
Using Templates I&amp;rsquo;m using a jQuery template for creating columns in a grid. Columns look like this:

 {cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; grid layout container {col12} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column {/col} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; closed column {col12last} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column last in container {/col} {/cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; end of container  You can try out the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;m playing with here:</description>

      <description>Simon Collison writes about the different forms of prototyping in ErskineLabs&amp;rsquo; Process Toolbox, describing the benefits of paper, wireframe, and browser prototypes.
As much as all parties may talk about requirements and argue over features, often they won’t really “get it” until they can see the concept represented visually, and understand its exact behaviour. This brings us on to various methods of prototyping.

      <description>Generally speaking I have 2 gripes with wireframes. One is that they&#39;re very limited and come with issues in terms of communicating design. Secondly, they&#39;re not fast and flexible enough as communication artifacts.
HTML wireframes and prototypes provide some relief from some of the issues, and I&#39;d like to hear what other people are looking for when doing HTML wireframes in order to fix and overcome the limitations of wireframes made in graphics software.</description>

      <description>Thanks for showing off your sick fast skills, Nick, and shaming us all. Oh, and it looks like that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a really useful site. I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss that.
You can download the OmniGraffle wireframe stencil Nick is using here for free, by the way. ;)

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/napkee-create-prototypes-balsamiq-mockups/</guid>
      <description>Napkee is a very exciting tool that extends the quick and easy wireframing process in Balsamiq Mockups by importing your Balsamiq files and generating interactive prototypes in Flex or HTML version.
To start off, you build your series of wireframes in Mockups, optionally creating links between pages. The screenshot below shows a wireframe of a fictional news site I created to try it out. I mocked up a site home page, and a login screen for my test.</description>

      <description>Nick Finck&amp;rsquo;s Puget Sound SIGCHI lecture on the Lifecycle of the Wireframe discusses Nick&amp;rsquo;s IA process. My overall strategy for IA is 3 step process; understanding the problem (note: not merely identifying the problem but really understanding it), find a solution (there may be more than one solution, but there is often only one right solution), and present the solution (a large part of your job as a IA is presenting your work so the client can understand the results).</description>

      <description>FlairBuilder is a cross-platform tool for rapid authoring of interactive wireframes and software prototypes. It focuses purely on wireframing/prototyping, and provides an experience that looks like it&#39;s targeted at apps like Axure, but work will cross-platform because it&#39;s built on Adobe AIR.
 The application provides a page/canvas editor onto which you may drag and drop UI components. Selecting a component provides a properties inspector so that may set dimensions and stylistic properties, text values, and any other available UI options.</description>

      <description>On Made By Many, Isaac Pinnock looks back at his 10 year history using wireframes and their evolution in IA practice from time consuming deliverable in functional specifications, to disposable artifacts of the design process. The notion that highly visual wireframes should be part of the design process resonates with me. http://www.madebymany.co.uk/the-future-of-wireframes-00991</description>

      <description>Justinmind Prototyper is a tool to design wireframes and run simulations for web, desktop and mobile applications. The product looks similar to Axure, and lets you define user interface elements using a drag and drop environment with component libraries, and attach actions to components. The prototypes allow you to map interactive behaviors to elements, define process logic and flow, and add functional specifications and annotations. Looks very full featured and offers the possibility of running a web server to deploy multiple prototypes that are viewable in a browser and allow users to comment on designs.</description>

      <description>Sketches are often better tools for communicating designs than high fidelity illustrations or schematics. The purpose of the sketch style wireframe is to prevent the intended audience from thinking about visual design and focus on the functionality and behavior you are proposing.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of this set of sketch stencils for OmniGraffle, based on the Wireframe Stencil. This set of user interface sketch stencils is designed for OmniGraffle 5.</description>

Among my favorite points are those about ownership and involvement. This is to do with ensuring that someone is driving the process and iterations, and making sure that the interaction design process doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, but is reviewed, validated, and informed by key team members, e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting for the past year or so to do sketch style wireframes in OmniGraffle. My first requests for sketchy line styles were made to OmniGroup in the Spring of 08 along with a few other users, and I posted this comment to the OG List about this feature. I knew how to do this in Visio, and had read that CAD users have something called a &amp;ldquo;Jitter&amp;rdquo; line style, so I quietly campaigned for this feature.</description>

      <description>Wireframes Magazine featured an entry on using sticky notes for UI design. I know a lot of us have done something like this before, whether it&amp;rsquo;s using sticky notes or something else. I have occasionally sketched large and used transparent vellum with tape in the past. http://wireframes.linowski.ca/?p=96</description>

      <title>Shades of Gray: Wireframes as Thinking Device</title>

      <description>Will Evans discusses how he uses wireframes in his design process. The story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before. It&amp;rsquo;s a description of concept design, using wireframes as the tool for finding the right design. One could use sketching just as well. He&amp;rsquo;s talking about that path we take as designers to frame the problem for discussion, extrapolate solutions from that discussion, and generate possible solution concepts. He calls his process one of divergence, transformation, and covergence.</description>

      <title>Mocklinkr Prototyping and Review Tool</title>

      <description>Mocklinkr is another new design mockup review service to hit the web. This one adds a little twist, however, that might be pretty useful. After you upload images of your designs or wireframes, Mocklinkr let&amp;rsquo;s you create clickable sections on the image linking to another image. This let&amp;rsquo;s you do very simple click-through prototypes to change state and navigate between pages. In a way, this seems a bit like the Berkeley GUIR Denim tool, which is sadly no longer available at the GUIR site.</description>

      <description>Peter Flynn gives a demo of wireframing in Adobe Flash Catalyst, aka Thermo. Every online demo I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of this product looks more and more exciting, and this is truly going to give Mac users a way to do easy interactive prototypes as our PC brothers and sisters can do with tools like Axure. I fully expect to be using this thing when it gets out of Preview release. It&amp;rsquo;s only slightly ironic that his first 5 minutes are talk about how wireframes are by definition, low fidelity, given my last post.</description>

      <title>Fear of the High Fidelity Wireframe</title>

      <description>In Twitter today, I posted a message that I need to resist putting rounded corners on boxes in wireframes. Then I got a few replies essentially saying that stylized elements shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in wireframes. Context is everything. Taken out of context, it is very difficult to possibly critique a specific design technique without knowing the how and why you&amp;rsquo;re using it. Because of that 140 character constraint in Twitter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really explain that this rounded corner example came from my hybrid high-fidelity wireframing and visual design document I was working on.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s OmniGraffle, not Original Gangster. It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since the last update to my OmniGraffle Wireframe Stencils. I&amp;rsquo;m due for a new version after some cleanup and organization into separate stencils to make use of OG5&amp;rsquo;s nice new stencil panel. The above is the current state of my working stencil in all its ugly glory. Also in my stencil directory are a bunch of pre-fabricated stencils for the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in the past 2 years at Sling and at Traction.</description>

      <description>Sumopaint, by Snap Group Ltd is looking to be a really slick Flash-based online graphics creation and editing tool. It has a very complete list of functionalities with shapes, brushes, layers, text editing, filters, and many of the features you&amp;rsquo;d expect from Photoshop or (ack) GIMP. Users can share images for community editing, create and view versions, and add comments. This looks like it might turn out to be an excellent resource for those looking at doing things like shared whiteboarding and prototyping without the real-time editing.</description>

      <description>Loren Baxter has created an excellent looking set of design patterns for Axure users. The kit provides droppable interface elements for demonstrating rich interactions like editing in place, lightbox effects, video embedding, and a bunch more. When I worked in a Windows only company, we used Axure and I loved how easy it made wireframing and prototyping simple interactions by just dragging and dropping. This tool kit will definitely make the job even easier.</description>

There are several nice illustrations in this article for those that need to explain what they are.

The icons you see here are some of the ones I plan to include in this new set. Any others you&amp;rsquo;d like to see here that aren&amp;rsquo;t already represented? These are the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve actually had to use in the past 3 or 4 years.</description>

      <description>Balsamiq Mockups is an incredible application for creating user interface mockups. The application allows you layout interface sketches using the 50 interface controls included. Controls are added to the canvas or notebook by dragging and dropping or by using an insert input with auto-completion suggestions. As with Visio, many controls may be easily customized by editing values in the properties panel, and may be modified to show state, e.g. selected, disabled, etc.</description>

      <description>About This 8.5 x 11 inch graph paper is made for visual designers, interaction designers, and information architects. You&#39;ll find styles for wireframing user interfaces, and story boarding interaction. I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s also used by animators and filmmakers. Enjoy.
 Scanning These cyan and gray grid pages are great for sketching, but also work well when producing high fidelity drawings. The boxes and grid lines of the cyan versions are non-photo blue, so you can easily remove them when scanned.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time sketching interface ideas on paper. Typically I sketch wireframes and storyboards on graph paper, then redo the final documents in OmniGraffle. But lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using paper for more than just sketching. Now, after spending time sketching ideas and working out design issues, I start to do higher fidelity drawings on paper, scan them, post them to our system. We discuss and iterate, and the process repeats until we&amp;rsquo;re happy, and I spend less time pushing pixels around.</description>

This might sound kind of pathetic, but seeing the pens and paper he uses is the kind of thing I really geek out on. I love that he&#39;s pimping out the Behance dot grid pads.</description>

      <description>I updated the OmniGraffle Web Design Template.
This web design template is for people who do wireframes and storyboards. The template was created for OmniGraffle Professional provides the basic layout for a design deliverable including the following master canvases: document title, section title, wireframe (portrait and landscape), storyboard, and blank. The wireframes were created at 950px wide with guides following the Blueprint CSS Grid system. Wireframes also have 2 small hairline marks around the 600px point to mark the approximate fold.</description>
