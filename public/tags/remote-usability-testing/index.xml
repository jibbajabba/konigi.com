      <description>Have you ever done the dance of holding a sketch up to your computer&amp;rsquo;s webcam or taken pictures of them with your iPhone to email to yourself or to colleagues? I&amp;rsquo;ve done that sort of thing for all of the years that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked remotely on design and development teams, because scanners get tired real fast. Frustrated with this process, I had largely given up, until a few months ago when I was looking for tools to share work on paper between students and teachers.</description>

      <description>Usaura is a free service for conducting 5-second tests. Upload a screenshot. Enter a question asking your respondents to respond by clicking somewhere on your screenshot. Copy the test url to give to participants or use Twitter to share the test. View the results as a heatmap or as click nodes with time-to-click data.
I set up a dummy test to try here.

      <title>YouEye: User testing with webcam eye tracking</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.youeye.com/&amp;lsquo;&amp;gt;YouEye looks interesting. The usability testing service allows you to create remote, unmoderated usability test sessions with a small number of tasks, and using the test participant&amp;rsquo;s web browser and web cam, they record eye-tracking results during the test. The service allows you to use paid self-identified test participants from different demographics. Would hope that you could recruit your own testers as well.

      <title>OpenHallway: Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing with Screen Recording</title>

      <description>Inspired by the 5 second test, a lot web-based services have cropped up to support remote usability testing. In the past few years, I&#39;ve been experimenting with some of these to conduct super small, unmoderated remote usability testing sessions. I&#39;ve used Morae extensively in the past, but for most of my needs, that&#39;s like using a sledgehammer on a pushpin.
I&#39;d been successful using fivesecondtest and Usabilla, who decided to sponsor me after I participated in the beta and gave feedback.</description>

      <description>UserTesting is a commercial service that promises automated usability testing.
You might think of this as a series of task-oriented usability test sessions where you only need enter a number of tasks for a test that will take approximately 15 minutes, enter the demographics (age, income) and technographics (computer experience) for the user you&#39;d like to target. UserTesting has a pool of paid testers who accept sessions, view your site with a floating layer that shows the tasks to complete while they record their voice, mouse clicks and movements, and page changes.</description>

      <description>Usabilla is a remote usability testing service that allows you to quickly create short tests that solicit feedback from your users. The service allows you to direct a few questions using screenshots of pages, e.g. you might ask users what do you like/not like about this page, where would you look to find X? Users then click on screenshot to add markers with their notes or answers.

      <title>userfly: Instant web-based usability testing service</title>

      <description>userfly.com from Chris Estreich on Vimeo. Userfly is a new web-based usability testing service that looks pretty exciting. When you set up a new test on the service, you&amp;rsquo;re given JavaScript to enter into your site template. Userfly captures sessions including link clicks and time spent on the page, and records screen events including mouse movement and keystrokes. This looks like a pretty nice service for certain types of observation. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any options for interacting with users, e.</description>

      <title>five second test: A simple online usability test</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/links/five-second-test-simple-online-usability-test/</link>

      <description>The five second test is a simple usability test that helps you measure the effectiveness of your user interfaces by getting users to look at a screen for 5 seconds, and then asking them to recall what they saw. This is something I typically do at the start of a usability test to see what users understand at a high level. Show them a screen, take it away, have them talk, ask them questions.</description>
