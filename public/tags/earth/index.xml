I don't care much for viewing the public twitter feed, so it's not very interesting to me. I'm still trying to imagine the context that makes these interfaces practical for everyday use. The place where it makes most sense to me is in the 10 foot experience, as with the wii news channel.</description></item><item><title>Yahoo! NewsGlobe vs. Wii News Channel</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/yahoo-newsglobe-vs-wii-news-channel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/yahoo-newsglobe-vs-wii-news-channel/</guid><description>Yahoo! launched the News Globe, which shows the top news stories of the day using a rotatable globe for navigation. The stories are depicted as red blocks stacked over geographic regions of the globe, with taller stacks indicating more stories. By default the interface will autoplay through the top stories, spinning the globe to get from story to story. Clicking a link to a news article jetisons you out of this otherworldly view of earth, and into text land on a separate page.</description></item></channel></rss>
