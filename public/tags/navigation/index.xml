I like that they make these options readily available wherever you are on the site. The longer drop downs like the registration form, for example, seem a little long for users on smaller screens, e.g. netbooks. 1.

A primary navigation widget is provided in the Nike Swoosh button, which reveals a list of a few of the most popular microsite destinations. A "More" link epxands the list to show all of the microsites.
1. Users click the Nike Swoosh logo to navigate across the Nike space to other microsites.</description></item><item><title>Atomic Floyd - The New State of Sound</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/atomic-floyd-new-state-sound/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/atomic-floyd-new-state-sound/</guid><description>Online presence and shop for high end head phone manufactorer Atomic Floyd.
