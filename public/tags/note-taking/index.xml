      <description>Cohdoo, the company that makes the iPhone whiteboard magnets that I&amp;rsquo;ve posted about have just released Highlight a nice iPhone app for voice recordings. It&amp;rsquo;s aimed at helping user researchers record interviews, and is just as useful for recording meetings and conference talks.
To start new sessions, press the New Recording button, and during the recording you can tap the huge green Mark Highlight button, which I could see being useful for marking new questions during interviews, or marking sections of conference talks.</description>

      <description>Pear Note from Useful Fruit Software is a powerful note-taking tool for Mac OS X. The application integrates text notes with audio and video you can record from interview sessions, meetings, etc.
The notes are time-marked to the video and slides that are being viewed during the recording, so you can click text from your notes, and the app will jump to that time in the recording so you can watch the video or see the slide that went with the note.</description>
