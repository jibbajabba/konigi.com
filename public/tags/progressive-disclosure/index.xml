      <description>The Fever RSS news reader provides some useful progressive disclosure/enhancement behaviors that hide features until they are needed. Many of the primary features are also provided as keyboard shortcuts. The resulting experience provides a subtle and minimalist aesthetic without compromising features.
1. The initial view of the app shows groups of items and the pages linking to them. The main navigator is shown in left sidebar.2. Selecting a category (&amp;quot;UX&amp;quot; in this example) displays a second column for browsing feeds in that category.</description>

      <description>The Apple Support site features a very simple &#34;email this page&#34; button in the upper right of the screen along with other tools like print and call support. The email widget starts out as an envelope icon. When clicked, the icon slides to the left and an input appears with a &#34;To&#34; label and a &#34;Send&#34; button. The user simply enters the recipients address and presses send. An AJAX progress spinner appears briefly, then a confirmation message, and the form collapses back to the icon.</description>

      <description>We covered Shelfari&#39;s hybrid button in their list views of bookshelf items. That example showed a single push button with an attached icon for drop down menu. The single button allowed for the use of a default behavior, while the drop down arrow allowed for the display of other options for the item. The drop down menu allowed users to make multiple selections, i.e. using checkbox behaviors, rather than just select one value in the drop down list.</description>

The birthday input filters and corrects date format. City/State shows suggestions. (The one in yellow is a browser auto-completion.</description>
