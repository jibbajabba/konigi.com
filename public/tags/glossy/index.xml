The presentation layer is sporting the clean and glossy look of white boxes with pale drop shadows that I'm fond of, as well as using soft white bevels with enough restraint to look good without going over the top. The overall look is softer, and might slightly reference the minimalist Hulu, but clearly outsexes that site.</description></item><item><title>Wunderbloc</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/wunderbloc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/wunderbloc/</guid><description>http://www.wunderbloc.com/</description></item><item><title>Adobe TV</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/adobe-tv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/adobe-tv/</guid><description>Adobe TV is a video on demand portal for information about Adobe products, including instructional videos and behind-the-scenes tours. The portal sports a dark color palette and subtle beveled edges, keeping consistent with the look and feel of applications like Lightroom and the various Labs projects, and giving the site the appearance of expensive audio/video componentry in a pro rack. The site is very simply organized, with only a handful or channels.</description></item></channel></rss>
