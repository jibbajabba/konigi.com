This iteration simplifies the paper slightly towards a more minimal style. There is also a Basic Graph Paper Notepad that provides a 24 x 24 grid without gutters.
More info in the store.

I've posted some photos I took quickly of the first set below. Better photos will come when the shopping cart is set up.
The first round of gear will include wireframe and storyboard notepads. Each of these pads include 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software.</description></item></channel></rss>
