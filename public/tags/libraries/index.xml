      <description>The New York Public Library Labs has begun testing a light usability testing system to supplement their formal tests, inspired by the Five Second Test method which was devised by Jared Spool and turned into a service by the guys at mayhem(method). The service, nicknamed Infomaki (info roll?), combines the type of service 5 second test provides, as well as allowing single question surveys for checking on things like simple labeling issues, which you might have tested using card sorting.</description>
