      <description>Sticky Jots is a set of storytelling sticky note paper and paper prototyping kits for designing mobile and tablet interfaces. The product is designed by Rae Milne and Pamela Jue, two grad students in the SVA Interaction Design program. 
Pam writes about the thinking behind Sticky Jots. The idea came from our constant prototyping and ideation process in almost every project this semester. While it’s great to do, it’s still frustrating how time consuming it can be.</description>

      <description>Everyone&#39;s getting in on on the physical paper capturing game using the iPhone&#39;s camera. Whitelines is one of my favorite sketch paper makers. They make great graph paper that reverses the grid using white lines over pale a gray paper. The result is that the grid it more subtle and less distracting
The Whitelines Link product is a free iPhone app that let&#39;s you capture sketches made on their new Whitelines Link papers.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve had a UX Stickynotes pad near me for a few weeks to play with. I&#39;m kind of a sticky notes nerd. I mostly like to place them in sketchbooks to mark and annotate, but also like them for brainstorming and doing info organization exercises. Sticky notes for UI sketches and sketchboards makes sense.
The sticky notes are A5 sized, with light non-photo blue dot grid, and the browser version has 960gs markers.</description>

      <title>Using the Storyboard Paper for Stop Motion Animation</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/using-storyboard-paper-stop-motion-animation/</link>

      <description>My son got his hands on the storyboard paper and started sketching a stop motion animation sequence in the cells. He just started his second session in a stop motion class. This is one of the things I used our printed graph paper for, but because that was printed in black/gray on our laser printer, I had a hard time knocking out the grid lines mixed in with his drawings.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m happy to announce that Konigi will soon be offering several products for creatives. I&#39;ve posted some photos I took quickly of the first set below. Better photos will come when the shopping cart is set up.
The first round of gear will include wireframe and storyboard notepads. Each of these pads include 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software.</description>

      <title>To All the Notebooks I&#39;ve Ever Loved Before</title>

      <description>I recently talked to someone about the graph/grid paper books I&#39;ve acquired over the years which have become a central part of my process. This is a listing of those pads, and a telling of their virtues. Rhodia This is my workhorse. At first I didn&#39;t get why so many designers carried these around, until I got my hands on one. To me the Rhodias are an all-around notepad for in office or outside use.</description>

      <title>Graph Paper Color Modifications</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/graph-paper-color-modifications/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/graph-paper-color-modifications/</guid>
      <description>I made some color modifications to the graph paper, bumping the cyan of the non-photo lines up slightly. I was noticing that when I print these in grayscale on a black and white laser printer, that the blues were a bit too pale to print clearly. This version works very well when printed. Color printer users will still be able to knock out the blue.
