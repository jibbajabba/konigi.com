      <description>Visualizing.org looks like an exciting new community devoted to information design and sensemaking--making sense of complex issues through data and design. An excerpt from their about page describes the site:
It&#39;s a place to showcase work, get feedback, ensure that your work is seen by lots of people and gets used by teachers, journalists, and conference organizers to help educate the public about various world issues. Visualizing is also a free resource to search for data.</description>

      <description>The jQuery Sparklines plugin generates sparklines (small inline charts) directly in the browser using data supplied either inline in the HTML, or via javascript. The plugin is compatible with most modern browsers and has been tested with Firefox 2+, Safari 3+, Opera 9 and Internet Explorer 6 &amp;amp; 7.

      <description>Cool infographic from Pixel Labs depicting the Browser wars, based on W3 Schools Browser Stats. Reminds me of the &#34;Napoleon&#39;s March&#34; graphic in Tufte&#39;s book.

      <title>Screen Resolution Statistics</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/screen-resolution-statistics/</link>

      <description>When it comes to researching user&#39;s screen resolution, I&#39;m a strong believer that vertical positioning matters most when considering key issues such as location of identifying elements like site name and h1-type headings, and elements that satisfy business rules such as ad location. The B&amp;amp;A article, &#34;Blasting the Myth of the Fold&#34; addresses this issue well, and I&#39;m in agreement that &#34;the fold&#34; matters little if the above issues are dealt with.</description>
