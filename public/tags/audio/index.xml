      <description>Music community site thesixtyone uses unobtrusive growl-like panels in the bottom right corner of the page for system alerts and messaging. Like growl or iminlikewithyou, these messages appear briefly and fade out. The effect is subtle and might be easily missed, but the addition of an ambient &#34;pop&#34; earcon (alert sound) tells you to look for the message. Nicely done.
1. System alerts appear in the bottom right corner, with accompanying alert sounds.</description>

      <title>JazzMutant multi-touch controllers</title>

      <description>JazzMutant creates the Lemur and Dexter, multi-touch hardware controllers for audio production, live music and media performance. What I like about this is that it shows how much closer multi-touch brings devices to the experience of using analogous hardware controls like knobs, buttons, and sliders without any physical limitations. I once blog bitched about the fact that the Traktor DJ software I played for a few years limited the fun, and the ability to mix with two hands because at the time you could only use one input device, the mouse, to control the mixer.</description>

      <description>Adtunes is a portal for finding music from TV commercials, film trailers, TV show and film soundtracks, and video games. I&#39;ve used the forums on this site several times to track down the creators of music in TV commercials.
