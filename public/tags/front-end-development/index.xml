      <description>feColorMatrix is an SVG filter that changes colors based on a transformation matrix. Every pixel’s color value (represented by an [R,G,B,A] vector) is matrix multiplied to create a new color.
This filter allows granular per channel color manipulation. Una Kravets wrote an excellent article explaining how to use it.</description>

      <title>Hello Hugo: Konigi is now a Static Site</title>

      <description>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I did it.
Choosing Static Site Generators In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/uilang/</guid>
      <description>uilang is a minimal, ui-focused programming language for web designers that handles click events, primarily for toggling classes and css display properties. I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on &#34;.try-it&#34; toggles class &#34;hidden&#34; on &#34;.info-box&#34;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that&#39;s a plus if you don&#39;t want or need someone else&#39;s implementation of those things.</description>

      <description>Adobe Labs&#39; Shadow is an application for Mac and Windows that allows you to preview and inspect your mobile website on iOS and Android devices.
After installing the software on your computer and any number of mobile devices, you can connect and pair them and all devices will be kept in sync with the web site you&#39;re previewing on your computer. This should help perform remote inspection and debugging so you can see HTML/CSS/JavaScript changes instantly on your devices.</description>

      <description>Browserstack allows you to stop relying on screenshot web apps or using multiple virtual machines to do your testing. The service gives you remote, web-based, VNC screen sharing using the web browser you choose, so you can test your web sites and apps in real time rather than relying on static screen comparisons.
Enter a URL to test, and select a target browser in the version of your choosing and screen resolution.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on Paul Irish and Divya Manian&amp;rsquo;s HTML5 Boilerplate after looking for a solution to fall back on a local jQuery library if Google&amp;rsquo;s CDN ever went south, and reading about how to use this technique for WordPress. Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq&amp;rsquo;s site.
HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites.</description>

      <description>The LESS Ruby gem compiles LESS code into CSS. LESS extends CSS with variables, mixins, operations, and extended rules, and uses existing CSS syntax. You simply rename your .css files as .less files and compile with a plugin or a simple app like LESS.app for the Mac.

      <description>Drawter has been sitting in my tabs for a few days now, and I keep coming back to play with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website&#39;s code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div&#39;s style properties within floating inspectors.</description>

      <description>The Yahoo! UI Library&amp;rsquo;s Grids CSS framework might seem hard to grok at first, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for the past year on a commercial project and find that it&amp;rsquo;s solid for liquid CSS layouts. The grid builder helps to visualize what&amp;rsquo;s possible and view the rather obscure naming conventions they use in CSS classes.
The framework offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns.</description>

      <description>In the latest A List Apart, Airbag Industries&amp;rsquo; Ethan Marcotte writes about designing fluid grids, rather than using the fixed pixel methods provided by most CSS layout frameworks. Marcotte describes that the technique of calculating percentages for column widths is the same method we use for calculating font sizes in ems. To calculate fluid grid dimensions, we first take a base font size of 100%, which is usually 16px in the majority of browsers when not altered by the user.</description>

      <description>Jason Santa Maria&amp;rsquo;s 24 Ways entry provides a very simple explanation of the modular layout strategy he uses. THe example html/css is super simple and easy to read, and the article itself is a short and easy to digest. We need to see more concise instructive articles like that. http://24ways.org/2008/making-modular-layout-systems</description>

      <description>Hidden Pixels recently rounded up the available CSS frameworks into a list. I happen to be evaluating CSS frameworks as well to find a flexible system to provide on a CMS I&amp;rsquo;m working on. The Hidden Pixels list isn&amp;rsquo;t very descriptive of the specific usage or value each framework has to offer, so I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a summary of each to make this a useful reference when evaluating the list.
The CSS presentation frameworks listed below provide the underlying CSS structure for typical web site needs.</description>

      <description>SproutCore has been getting some buzz after the June Apple WWDC, where SproutCore was demoed. This is an MVC framework that builds a standards-based application that runs entirely in the browser and is not tied to a single scripting language to power the back end. The framework is being used to drive the new MobileMe service from Apple.
SproutCore is a framework for building applications in JavaScript with remarkably little amounts of code.</description>

Websites can use the software to support behaviors like drag and drop from the desktop, easier file uploads, acquisition of feeds and information, and native desktop notifications. The site is showing very cool demos right now including dragging and dropping photos from the desktop to a web browser, live image manipulation, and live refreshing IRC chatrooms in the browser.</description>

      <description>The Multiple IE Installer is a must have resource for front end developers. I had to configure a new computer for myself because of a recent job change, so that meant installing all of my design/development tools again. On my new MacBook Pro, I run VMWare and just ran Tredosoft&amp;rsquo;s Multiple IE Installer for Windows XP. On an XP machine with IE7 (you must upgrade to IE7 before running this), the application will allow you to select versions of IE 3, 4, 5, and 6 to install.</description>
