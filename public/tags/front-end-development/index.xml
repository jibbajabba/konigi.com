Here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I did it.
Choosing Static Site Generators In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</description></item><item><title>RemoteIE: Remote Testing for Internet Explorer</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/remoteie-remote-testing-internet-explorer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/remoteie-remote-testing-internet-explorer/</guid><description>The Microsoft Remote Desktop app lets you use Azure RemoteApp to test your site on IE (on Windows 10 Technical Preview from anywhere).

I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on ".try-it" toggles class "hidden" on ".info-box"&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that's a plus if you don't want or need someone else's implementation of those things.</description></item><item><title>Adobe Shadow Mobile Device Testing</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/adobe-shadow-mobile-device-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/adobe-shadow-mobile-device-testing/</guid><description>Adobe Labs' Shadow is an application for Mac and Windows that allows you to preview and inspect your mobile website on iOS and Android devices.

Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq's site.
HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites.</description></item><item><title>Google Chrome Extensions for web developers</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/google-chrome-extensions-web-developers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/google-chrome-extensions-web-developers/</guid><description>Google Chromeâ€™s developer extensions are useful in-browser web development tools for such things as testing pages on various screen resolutions, analyzing app performance, working with HTML, CSS, JS, generating lorem ipsum greeking, and more.

It wasn't until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website's code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div's style properties within floating inspectors.</description></item><item><title>Ultimate Guide To Grid-Based Web Design</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/ultimate-guide-grid-based-web-design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/ultimate-guide-grid-based-web-design/</guid><description>Noupe offers up a complete guide to techniques and tools for designing web layouts with grids.

Grids CSS</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/yahoo-grids-css/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/yahoo-grids-css/</guid><description>The Yahoo! UI Library's Grids CSS framework might seem hard to grok at first, but I've been using it for the past year on a commercial project and find that it's solid for liquid CSS layouts. The grid builder helps to visualize what's possible and view the rather obscure naming conventions they use in CSS classes.
The framework offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns.</description></item><item><title>Litmus Browser Testing Software</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/litmus-browser-testing-software/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/litmus-browser-testing-software/</guid><description>Litmus is a web browser testing service that lets you test your web pages against 23 browser versions on 3 platforms as well as testing email on 16 different mail clients.
