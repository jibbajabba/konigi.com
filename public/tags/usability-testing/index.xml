      <description>PowWow is a free simple service for scheduling user research using your Google Calendar. The fine folks at Pointless Corp (aka Viget) created this as a side project for handling scheduling of user interviews and testing, but could be used for any kind of event.
There are other apps like this that remove the fuss of coordinating schedules via email. PowWow does it simply, and provides a polished and pleasing experience.</description>

      <description>AirServer is an AirPlay receiver for Mac/PC that allows you to receive AirPlay feeds in up to full 1080p HD. It works similar to an Apple TV, so you can stream content or Mirror your display from your iOS devices or Mountain Lion to your desktop computer. The app was made for game and video streaming, but would work perfectly for application demos and presentation or usability testing, when coupled with a concurrent video recording of the user&#39;s face and hands.</description>

@dakotareese tipped me that some users report problems using apps that hack into Airplay. More info here.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/mr-tappy-video-rig-tablets-and-mobile-devices/</guid>
      <description>Mr Tappy is a kit for filming mobile phones, tablet computers and handheld devices from the user&#39;s point of view. Looks like a great alternative to setting up your own DIY rig, and costs $289.
Originally designed by Nick Bowmast as a filming rig for iPad usability testing, Mr Tappy lets you capture or share user interaction with mobile devices during user experience research, product demonstrations or classroom presentations. Attach your webcam and any type of mobile device, set the camera height and angle, and record.</description>

      <description>Usabilla is one of the remote, unmoderated usability test services I&#39;ve reviewed and used in the past (full disclosure: they also now sponsor this site). They&#39;ve added mobile testing to their remote, unmoderated testing service. The new feature lets users participate by using their smartphones or tablets to test the screenshots or urls you specify in each task or scenario.
As with their past offering, participants are stepped through each scenario and asked to respond by adding markers to screens and notes/responses to your questions.</description>

      <title>Usaura: Free 5-second tests</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/links/usaura-free-5-second-tests/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/usaura-free-5-second-tests/</guid>
      <description>Usaura is a free service for conducting 5-second tests. Upload a screenshot. Enter a question asking your respondents to respond by clicking somewhere on your screenshot. Copy the test url to give to participants or use Twitter to share the test. View the results as a heatmap or as click nodes with time-to-click data.
I set up a dummy test to try here.

      <title>YouEye: User testing with webcam eye tracking</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.youeye.com/&#39;&amp;gt;YouEye looks interesting. The usability testing service allows you to create remote, unmoderated usability test sessions with a small number of tasks, and using the test participant&#39;s web browser and web cam, they record eye-tracking results during the test. The service allows you to use paid self-identified test participants from different demographics. Would hope that you could recruit your own testers as well.

      <description>Zurb&#39;s Clue is another great 5 second test service. They describe it as a fun and easy way to test what people remember on your website.
To use, enter a URL for a page you&#39;d like to test, they generate a screenshot, and provide you with URLs for the test and the test report. Here&#39;s an example using this site: test and report. Feel free to mock my home page at will.</description>

      <description>Harry Brignull has been posting some great quick tips for doing mobile usability testing including how to record from two webcams using an application called AmCap and how to craft inexpensive usability testing sleds for mobile phones.

      <title>WhatUsersDo.com Review on 90 Percent of Everything</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</guid>
      <description>Harry Brignull did a thorough review of WhatUsersDo.com, a UK-based remote, unmoderated, qualitative usability testing service. To use the service, you pay £25-£30 per participant and you get back screen recordings with audio of them thinking aloud during the tasks. The test participants are chosen from a pool of users paid to take usability tests, similar to usertesting.com.
As Brignull notes, this is possibly valuable to companies with little experience doing usability testing on their own before, but is less likely to be of value to companies with the experience and budget for doing moderated usability research on their own, or with a usability research consultancy.</description>

      <title>OpenHallway: Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing with Screen Recording</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/links/openhallway-unmoderated-remote-usability-testing-screen-recording/</link>

      <description>Inspired by the 5 second test, a lot web-based services have cropped up to support remote usability testing. In the past few years, I&#39;ve been experimenting with some of these to conduct super small, unmoderated remote usability testing sessions. I&#39;ve used Morae extensively in the past, but for most of my needs, that&#39;s like using a sledgehammer on a pushpin.
I&#39;d been successful using fivesecondtest and Usabilla, who decided to sponsor me after I participated in the beta and gave feedback.</description>
