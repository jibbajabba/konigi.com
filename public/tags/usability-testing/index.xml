      <title>Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing</title>

      <description>About Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing (URUT) is a technique for conducting usability testing where participants take test sessions alone and without the presence or interaction with a facilitator. Sessions are usually conducted with the aid of a remote testing software service.
While moderated testing is preferred, URUT may be beneficial when budget or time constraints are an issue. Because URUT is conducted asynchronously, there are some disadvantages. For instance, when instructed, users may not employ the think aloud approach on their own without prompting, users cannot seek support including asking for clarification if tasks are not clear, and facilitators cannot ask follow up questions.</description>

      <description>PowWow is a free simple service for scheduling user research using your Google Calendar. The fine folks at Pointless Corp (aka Viget) created this as a side project for handling scheduling of user interviews and testing, but could be used for any kind of event.
There are other apps like this that remove the fuss of coordinating schedules via email. PowWow does it simply, and provides a polished and pleasing experience.</description>

      <description>AirServer is an AirPlay receiver for Mac/PC that allows you to receive AirPlay feeds in up to full 1080p HD. It works similar to an Apple TV, so you can stream content or Mirror your display from your iOS devices or Mountain Lion to your desktop computer. The app was made for game and video streaming, but would work perfectly for application demos and presentation or usability testing, when coupled with a concurrent video recording of the user&amp;rsquo;s face and hands.</description>

Attach your webcam and any type of mobile device, set the camera height and angle, and record.</description>

      <description>Usabilla is one of the remote, unmoderated usability test services I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed and used in the past (full disclosure: they also now sponsor this site). They&amp;rsquo;ve added mobile testing to their remote, unmoderated testing service. The new feature lets users participate by using their smartphones or tablets to test the screenshots or urls you specify in each task or scenario.
As with their past offering, participants are stepped through each scenario and asked to respond by adding markers to screens and notes/responses to your questions.</description>

      <description>Usaura is a free service for conducting 5-second tests. Upload a screenshot. Enter a question asking your respondents to respond by clicking somewhere on your screenshot. Copy the test url to give to participants or use Twitter to share the test. View the results as a heatmap or as click nodes with time-to-click data.
I set up a dummy test to try here.

      <description>&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.youeye.com/&amp;lsquo;&amp;gt;YouEye looks interesting. The usability testing service allows you to create remote, unmoderated usability test sessions with a small number of tasks, and using the test participant&amp;rsquo;s web browser and web cam, they record eye-tracking results during the test. The service allows you to use paid self-identified test participants from different demographics. Would hope that you could recruit your own testers as well.

      <title>WhatUsersDo.com Review on 90 Percent of Everything</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</guid>
      <description>Harry Brignull did a thorough review of WhatUsersDo.com, a UK-based remote, unmoderated, qualitative usability testing service. To use the service, you pay £25-£30 per participant and you get back screen recordings with audio of them thinking aloud during the tasks. The test participants are chosen from a pool of users paid to take usability tests, similar to usertesting.com.
As Brignull notes, this is possibly valuable to companies with little experience doing usability testing on their own before, but is less likely to be of value to companies with the experience and budget for doing moderated usability research on their own, or with a usability research consultancy.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the 5 second test, a lot web-based services have cropped up to support remote usability testing. In the past few years, I&#39;ve been experimenting with some of these to conduct super small, unmoderated remote usability testing sessions. I&#39;ve used Morae extensively in the past, but for most of my needs, that&#39;s like using a sledgehammer on a pushpin.
I&#39;d been successful using fivesecondtest and Usabilla, who decided to sponsor me after I participated in the beta and gave feedback.</description>

      <description>Treejack is a tool to help you test the effectiveness of an information architecture.&amp;nbsp; Use it to find out which categories are strong, which labels need tweaking and what tasks people are struggling with.&amp;nbsp; Because you can upload an existing or proposed IA, and test with participants remotely, you get rapid feedback at a fraction of the cost of in-person testing.
Often, usability testing only reveals flaws with the interaction and interface elements.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Usabilla for some time now as a beta tester with the expectation of utilizing it on several projects. They&amp;rsquo;ve continued to make improvements to the app, with the help of our feedback. They&amp;rsquo;ve also posted new information on their site to familiarize users with their product. This is a review of my recent test with the latest revisions.
Creating Tests The process is still quite simple: 1) Create a new test, 2) Add pages to test either from images you upload or using URLs, 3) Use the pre-defined tasks and add your own tasks, 4) Invite users to participate.</description>

You might think of this as a series of task-oriented usability test sessions where you only need enter a number of tasks for a test that will take approximately 15 minutes, enter the demographics (age, income) and technographics (computer experience) for the user you&#39;d like to target. UserTesting has a pool of paid testers who accept sessions, view your site with a floating layer that shows the tasks to complete while they record their voice, mouse clicks and movements, and page changes.</description>

      <description>Jeff Sexton got Patrick Sullivan, Jr. to list the top things not to do when conducting a usability test. The top 6 list should serve as a good reminder for the UX Designer who does the occasional user test.
1) Never ask, “What do you think about this?”
2) Don’t feed the tester with your question.
3) Don’t let users be the designers.
4) Don’t let the statistics fool you.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability testing is the measurement of the usability of a product or service. The definition from usability.gov succinctly describes the process.
In a usability test, representative users try to do typical tasks with the product, while observers, including the development staff, watch, listen, and take notes. The product can be a Web site, Web application, or any other product. It does not have to be a finished product. You should be testing prototypes from early paper-based stages through fully functional later stages.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability is an approach to product development that incorporates direct user feedback throughout the development cycle in order to reduce costs and create products and tools that meet user needs. There are many definitions of usability from books by usability professionals.
Two international standards define usability and human-centered (or user-centered) design:
&amp;quot;[Usability refers to] the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.</description>

      <description>The New York Public Library Labs has begun testing a light usability testing system to supplement their formal tests, inspired by the Five Second Test method which was devised by Jared Spool and turned into a service by the guys at mayhem(method). The service, nicknamed Infomaki (info roll?), combines the type of service 5 second test provides, as well as allowing single question surveys for checking on things like simple labeling issues, which you might have tested using card sorting.</description>

      <description>userfly.com from Chris Estreich on Vimeo. Userfly is a new web-based usability testing service that looks pretty exciting. When you set up a new test on the service, you&amp;rsquo;re given JavaScript to enter into your site template. Userfly captures sessions including link clicks and time spent on the page, and records screen events including mouse movement and keystrokes. This looks like a pretty nice service for certain types of observation. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any options for interacting with users, e.</description>

The toolkit is a collection of forms, checklists and other useful documents for conducting usability tests and user interviews. http://www.stcsig.org/usability/resources/toolkit/toolkit.html</description>

      <description>The five second test is a simple usability test that helps you measure the effectiveness of your user interfaces by getting users to look at a screen for 5 seconds, and then asking them to recall what they saw. This is something I typically do at the start of a usability test to see what users understand at a high level. Show them a screen, take it away, have them talk, ask them questions.</description>

      <title>Silverback: Usability Testing Software for the Mac</title>

      <description>Silverback launches to provide UX pros with Macintoshes a simple, inexpensive tool for recording usability test sessions, so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to ever touch another Windows box if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to. (I&amp;rsquo;m kidding. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will at some point in your life.)
Silverback provides most of the functionality you need for discount usability. People wanting a full featured tool like Morae won&amp;rsquo;t find their solution here, but if all you want is to organize test sessions, capture audio/video of screen interactions and participants face and voice, then Silverback might be for you.</description>

      <description>TechCrunch has some photos of a usability lab used by the Gmail team at Google. Some of the photos include earlier iterations of Google Chat that were being tested in the lab.
I only see shots of the observers&amp;rsquo; room in the photos, but there&amp;rsquo;s some description of their testing room as well.
It’s a small room with a large flat screen monitor, along with a desk and computer. It also has a number of discrete cameras (and a microphone) that keep an eye on the user herself as well as the screen.</description>

      <description>TechSmith has published a useful tutorial that shows how to view where people clicked during sessions. Morae recordings use TechSmith’s Rich Recording Technology (RRT) to capture video, audio, camera input, as well as all sorts of data, including keyboard entry, screen text, web page changes, mouse clicks, and system events. Use Manager’s Search Results pane to help you focus in on this valuable information to support your findings.
 This feature is pretty hidden, so Morae users will want to check this out.</description>

      <title>Paper Prototyping with Morae</title>

      <description>Userfocus provides some inspiration for capturing paper prototype tests with Morae and a webcam. Their method invovlves positioning the camera over the prototype, connect the cam directly to the PC, viewing the camera live in a video editor, and recording the output of the editor in Morae. This method is ingenious. It gives you all of the agility of doing a paper prototype, with the flexbility and control of using Morae for the observation, note taking, and highlight reel creation.</description>
