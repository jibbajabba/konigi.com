      <description>Since starting work at Balsamiq I&#39;ve been doing customer support every day. Part of that work is repeatedly referencing the same URLS and instructions for frequently asked questions. Peldi and Val handle the volume by using Typinator, a Mac utility that lets you define text shortcuts that you trigger to complete these answers.
Years ago, pre-OS X, used something called TypeIt4Me to handle this and am stoked to have this kind of a tool back in my aresenal.</description>

      <description>How I try and occasionally succeed at finding focus.
Ambient information and notification is killing me; so much so I&#39;m mostly avoiding email, I&#39;m disabling Growl notifications for apps, and looking at stuff like Tweetie on my own time rather than leaving it always on. I have to admit that I occasionally have a hard time focusing on tasks and have sometimes put more effort into tweaking my systems for getting things done than I should.</description>

      <description>As many of my friends and colleagues know, I&#39;m one of those people that read David Allen&#39;s Getting Things Done, got the religion, and tried various methods for planning and managing project tasks, using both software and paper. In the past few years, like many, I&#39;ve tweaked my approach, taking bits and pieces from here and there to settle on the solution that&#39;s most suitable for the way I work.</description>
