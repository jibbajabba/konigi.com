It&amp;rsquo;s a full flash build powered by an xml cms. The design was inspired by traveling around a city, always being on the go. The sites most prominent feature is the bands new video playing as the background.

      <description>Metalab&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic evokes the crisp, metalic edges and rounded stylistic elements that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to associate with Apple. You can see it in the details of their gradients, shadows and lighting effects. The visual style is clean, but what I found most enjoyable was the combined use of vertical tabs and carousels on the home page&amp;#8212;essentially their portfolio. The message is really simple and bold too. &amp;ldquo;We make interfaces, we strive for pixel perfection.</description>

      <description>Winkreative&amp;rsquo;s site is a minimalist site that feels like it makes a few design references to elements of Monocle site they designed for the magazine.

      <description>Fever is a feed reading server product. The product site features a single-page design, with well-organized and clear product information at the top, and navigation anchors that scroll the page down. All of the features you need from the service&amp;#8212;purchasing info, account info, customer support&amp;#8212;are included dynamically in the single page, so once you&amp;rsquo;ve purchased the product, for instance, your customer info is populated into the account area.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/palm-pre/</guid>
      <description>Palm&amp;rsquo;s Pre product page has a serious, polished look that I assume is targeted at a &amp;ldquo;grown up,&amp;rdquo; no-nonsense audience, judging by the business user scenarios in the video and the big kitchen counter backdrop. The smooth, rounded corners of the page&amp;rsquo;s UI elements echo the pebble shape of the phone and the circular shapes of the Pre OS. I like the use of depth of field with the full bleed photo, the hover of the boxes on the right, the change in state when clicking the site search box, and the categorized features at the bottom.</description>

      <description>The site for the Park Ave Armory, a non-profit venue for the arts in New York City is a clean, modern looking site with a simple 2-3 column grid that makes minimal use of graphics and presents information simply. There&amp;rsquo;s small change in the logo and heading colors to add some variety and the navigation is clear.

      <description>Behance&amp;rsquo;s 99 Percent Conference bills itself as one &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;that focuses less on inspiration, and more on how idea generation and organization come together to make ideas happen.&amp;rdquo; Not suprisingly, they have one of the best looking conference sites to set the stage, showcasing the speakers and event. The treatment of the slash motif morphing into the trapezoids repeated throughout the site in the photography is cool. I like the dark bold color treatment and the clean hierarchy in tables, forms, and text.</description>

      <description>I like the simplicity of the portfolio pages on graphic and book designer Richard Hollis&amp;rsquo; site. The layout of the thumbnails of the design work as if posted on presentation board is nice. Clever shadows on the folded pieces are a nice touch as well. The enlarged images in the product details put the work front and center, with no need for explanation. Via siteInspire

Their site sports the kind of clean rounded corners and beveled edges we come to associate with Apple, but brings in a more colorful and rich palette with excellent illustrations and product icons throughout. Glassy reflective marquees melt into the 2 column product info below, and big icons and buttons make clear targets for calls to action.</description>

Neutral background colors are easy on the eyes. There&amp;rsquo;s great attention being paid to the details. Icons are well designed and clear, forms are laid out well, everything is perfectly aligned, and page elements direct the user through every facet of administration.</description>

DAYTUM is a wonderful evolution of the personal annual report, bringing obsessive loggers a place to count whatever comes to mind and visualize that data beautifully in the personal and community space.</description>

      <description>The slight redesign of the surface on Fancast is a lovely updating that comes along with the site&amp;rsquo;s latest release and new inventory of video content. The presentation layer is sporting the clean and glossy look of white boxes with pale drop shadows that I&amp;rsquo;m fond of, as well as using soft white bevels with enough restraint to look good without going over the top. The overall look is softer, and might slightly reference the minimalist Hulu, but clearly outsexes that site.</description>

      <description>The Heads of State are a 2 person design studio in Brooklyn and Seattle. Their recently redesigned site showcases the strong portfolio of print work on projects including book covers, magazine illustrations, and corporate identity. I love the simple, powerful covers on the Rosenfeld Media books, and after diving into their site, I think I&amp;rsquo;d love even more to hire them in the future.

Clicking on the project turns out the lights (background color) and displays either a slideshow of project screens or a video reel.</description>

      <description>My first impression when landing on the MAD Museum site is that there is a sense dynamic tension between the huge decorative shapes that make up the bold MAD logo and the clean layout, whose grid and the solid blocks of type and photos feel very modern. There is an appropriate feeling in that tension that works well to characterize a museum like this, that houses objects of such a wide range of styles and periods.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of splash pages, but I really like the illustrations on the splash screen menu and the minimal approach to navigation. I could see repeating the illustrations in the header as well, though, rather than using the pop up menu. I also think it would be nice if they would be shown in color on the splash page. Those great illustrations shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hidden. The layout is clean and the style is very soft and elegant.</description>

      <description>Brooklyn visual designer Jason Santa Maria redesigns his site with a more flexible system that will allow him to adapt the design of each entry to suit the content. He notes that this is a redefined focus on art direction, and a magazine approach to content publishing outside of the typical confines of a CMS templating system.
I liked previous site design, and its reference to physical print. But I find that while the new visual style might refer back to the feeling of print, this visual style is more appealing to me as a someone who tends to be drawn to modern design.</description>

      <description>This is a clean, minimalist portfolio. I like the grid of projects in the portfolio and the simple project pages and slideshows. The feeling is very clean and easy to read, even with medium contrast gray text. The brown/orange accent color works very well on buttons and highlighted text.
The only thing I thought odd was that the site name didn&amp;rsquo;t accompany the logo in the upper left. I realize the name is visible title bar and footer, but it might be useful to see near the logo if you arrived from an inner page.</description>

The layout of the text-heavy Approach page and the Portfolio pages is clean and easy to read, although I thought the Approach pages did a better job at indicating the hierarchy of page elements.</description>

      <description>Fi, the Stockholm/New York City agency that was formerly known as Fantasy Interactive built up its history by making glossy flash sites where nearly every element on the screen moved and had audio attached to it. The agency has matured over the years and uses Flash more selectively and strategically now, and the name change is meant to reflect that maturity. The founder talks about usability as the thing that will characterize Fi in the future, and their clean site update reflects that.</description>

      <description>Represent Recruitment is a boutique career placement agency in London, UK serving professionals in creative design industries. The recruiter&amp;rsquo;s site is a nicely implemented minimalist site that presents information with little fanfare. Navigation is very shallow, making content easy to traverse. One thing I think would work to this site&amp;rsquo;s benefit is to move the job listings up in the hierarchy of pages and offer email notifications or RSS feeds of new jobs.</description>

      <title>HUGE</title>

      <description>HUGE is a design agency specializing in websites, software applications, and branding. Their site has a modern, minimalist feel. The large bold type, their similarly selective use of large photography, and the subtle hints at the grid, lend an obvious sense of hierarchy and a clear message about what this agency is about&amp;#8212;crisp messaging and confident design. As I look at this mosaic of screens, there&amp;rsquo;s something about the openness, colors, and clear separation of large and small that is light, feels asymmetrically bold, and gives me a generally good feeling.</description>
