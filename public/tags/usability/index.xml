The tool opens the heuristics in a side panel next to the website you enter. You select a problem area on the screen, related to one of the usability heuristics and a callout appears for you to add notes and recommendations. When you're done a report is available with screenshots and your notes for each issue.</description></item><item><title>Noticeability Evaluation</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/noticeability-evaluation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/noticeability-evaluation/</guid><description>Definition A research technique for learning whether people notice key elements in your design.

Once a website is posted on Concept Feedback, members are invited to provide reviews. On average, a concept receives 12 or more unique reviews, while some can generate as many as 100. Because of the nature of the community, feedback can cover a variety of topics, including design, usability, content and strategy. Concept Feedback is best for getting design-related feedback from a wide audience and can be used at all stages of development.</description></item><item><title>Confirming Passwords Is Annoying: Is There a Better Way?</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/confirming-passwords-annoying-there-better-way/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/confirming-passwords-annoying-there-better-way/</guid><description>This an article from March 09 by Kevin Vigneault of Viget that explores some techniques using Javascript to create more usable password inputs in forms. The ideas range from using a checkbox or button to temporarily show the password or changing type from text to password when the input is not in focus. Great ideas.

Convertbot could be viewed as the more playful and whimsical of the 2 apps. He writes:
Fun isn’t always the new usable. There are situations in which usability is more important than playfulness and those in which it’s the other way around.</description></item><item><title>iPhone is all Fun and Games</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/iphone-all-fun-and-games/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/iphone-all-fun-and-games/</guid><description>Fred Beecher wrote the excellent article "The iPhone is Not Easy to Use: A New Direction for User Experience" on Johnny Holland to talk about why the iPhone is not easy to use (at first), and why it changes the game for user experience designers. The examples illustrate how gestural interfaces are hidden, and lack the affordances of physical buttons. But the real story here is how the iPhone brings one thing to the experience that is more important than usability&amp;#8212;fun.</description></item><item><title>Don't Forget Heuristics</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/dont-forget-heuristics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/dont-forget-heuristics/</guid><description>Theresa Neil continues her tips for designing great Flex UX's showcasing interfaces that exemplify Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.
Don’t forget the usability basics. Jakob Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics are as relevant now as they were in 1999. I stress this because I looked at the Flex showcase recently, and it looks like many of the applications are not built with these best practices in mind.

This is an article by members of the Design Center, Hitachi discusses the team's research on determinants to apparent usability, based on tests of design and psychology students. These results show that the apparent usability is less correlated with the inherent usability compared to to the apparent beauty.</description></item><item><title>Usability</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/usability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/usability/</guid><description>Definition Usability is an approach to product development that incorporates direct user feedback throughout the development cycle in order to reduce costs and create products and tools that meet user needs. There are many definitions of usability from books by usability professionals.
Two international standards define usability and human-centered (or user-centered) design:
&amp;quot;[Usability refers to] the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.</description></item><item><title>Feng-GUI: Feng Shui for Graphic User Interfaces?</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/feng-gui-feng-shui-graphic-user-interfaces/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/feng-gui-feng-shui-graphic-user-interfaces/</guid><description>This is an interesting idea in principle. Feng-GUI helps you find out how people see your website, photo or ad and which areas are getting most of the attention. Feng-GUI simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals,
and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.
This offers designers, advertisers and creatives, a Pre-testing technology that predicts performance of an image, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the Flow of Attention.</description></item><item><title>Untitled Document Syndrome</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/untitled-document-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/untitled-document-syndrome/</guid><description>John Gruber laments the illogical, yet human, tendency to avoid saving new documents, which occasionally leads users to the loss of data when an "Untitled Document" is left in limbo and a crash leaves them scrambling to figure out what happened to it. The point is that users often can't be bothered with things like figuring out where to put this thing on a file system because we're too busy with the task at hand, e.</description></item><item><title>Account Sign-in: 8 Design Mistakes to Avoid</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/account-sign-8-design-mistakes-avoid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/account-sign-8-design-mistakes-avoid/</guid><description>&amp;quot;I don't want to develop a relationship with these guys.
