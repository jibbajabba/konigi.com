UI Library's Grids CSS framework might seem hard to grok at first, but I've been using it for the past year on a commercial project and find that it's solid for liquid CSS layouts. The grid builder helps to visualize what's possible and view the rather obscure naming conventions they use in CSS classes.
The framework offers four preset page widths, six preset templates, and the ability to stack and nest subdivided regions of two, three, or four columns.</description></item><item><title>Boks: Visual Grid Editor</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/boks-visual-grid-editor/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/boks-visual-grid-editor/</guid><description>Boks is a cross-platform AIR app for visually creating grids using the Blueprint CSS framework. The app provides an inspector for setting up the page, column and gutter widths, provides typography settings for setting the vertical rhythm of your text, and generates the CSS and grid background image for you to export. Once your grid is set, draw sections in your grid, add lorem ipsum greeking, and the export file will include an HTML template with all of your divs laid out for you.</description></item><item><title>Grid Calculator</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/grid-calculator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/grid-calculator/</guid><description>Matthew Pennel's Grid Calculator is a tool to calcuate a grid based on easy to use slider controls and forms. [A]llows you to choose the font size you are going to use, and then select the number of columns, column width, and gutter width based on that base font size. As you fiddle with the dimensions, the total width is dynamically updated, so you can check that you haven’t gone over that magic 1024px!</description></item><item><title>GridMaker Script for PhotoShop</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/gridmaker-script-photoshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/gridmaker-script-photoshop/</guid><description>Andrew Ingram's GridMaker is a brilliant script for Photoshop that can be used to automatically generate guides in your PSD. The script allows you to enter the series of columns that should be laid out both horizontally and vertically. Then you set the maximum dimensions for the canvas. To generate a Blueprint grid, for instance, you'd enter "30,10" to create a PSD with a series of repeating columns of alternating 30 pixel units and 10 pixel gutters.</description></item><item><title>GridFox - The Grid Layout Firefox Extension</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/gridfox-grid-layout-firefox-extension/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/gridfox-grid-layout-firefox-extension/</guid><description>GridFox is a Firefox extension that overlays a grid on any website.
