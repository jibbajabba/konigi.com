Any app that lets you do freehand user interface sketches, either using finger tips or a capacitive stylus like the Pogo Sketch is what we're sharing here. If you drop non-iPad sketches, they will be booted.</description></item><item><title>fueledbycoffee iPad Sketch Blog</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/fueledbycoffee-ipad-sketch-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/fueledbycoffee-ipad-sketch-blog/</guid><description>I've been telling people how much I dig Adobe's free Ideas app and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for sketching on the iPad. Craighton Berman's Fueled by Coffee sketchblog will give you an idea of what sketches can look like using these tools. Ideas is super simple and smoothens your lines so things look naturally drawn.
I'm really loving it. The adjustment is taking time, and it's not as quick as pen and paper, but it's slightly more natural using a Pogo Sketch Stylus.</description></item><item><title>Sarah Mitchell's Thoughts from Interaction '10</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/sarah-mitchells-thoughts-interaction-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/sarah-mitchells-thoughts-interaction-10/</guid><description>LA UX designer Sarah Mitchell has posted an excellent set of sketch notes from Interaction 10.
