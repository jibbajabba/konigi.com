Capture screens directly from Adobe CC, Sketch, Chrome, or anything else on your screen and it&amp;rsquo;ll be ready for critique in Slack, with comments and annotation.

Here are some of my notes from that visit. More 99u notes to follow.
Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case.</description></item><item><title>How might we...</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/how-might-we/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/how-might-we/</guid><description>We know that starting with why is important to product design, but what comes next? "How" would definitely come soon after. But there are many ways to propose how to begin exploring possibilities. The 99u points to a number of questions to ask before starting a project, and how language matters. They refer to Warren Berger's article in the Harvard Business Review about one of the questions top innovators ask when confronted with a design challenge.</description></item><item><title>Frontify: Design review, documentation, and specification app</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/frontify-design-review-documentation-and-specification-app/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/frontify-design-review-documentation-and-specification-app/</guid><description>Frontify looks like an interesting SaaS product for design teams. It provides collaborative features for getting design feedback, creating specifications, documentation and style guides, and linking pages together.
The commenting and linking features are what you'd expect, but what I was really impressed with are the measures, colors, and typography tools for generating style guides. Very nicely done. There are additional capabilities for code export &amp;amp; integration with their API.</description></item><item><title>Macaw: Code-savvy web design tool</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/macaw-code-savvy-web-design-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/macaw-code-savvy-web-design-tool/</guid><description>Macaw is a forthcoming Mac application for designing pages for web browsers that are ready to use as web-native code. The app runs natively in html and css, and provides excellent export to clean html and css.
There are some great optimizations for nudging/pudging on a grid, and for setting properties that make sense for css—thinking of positioning and dimensions.
The outline view is a nice way to browse through all the groups in the document and adding container tags and/or classes for semantic html publishing.</description></item><item><title>GoodUI Newsletter: Ideas for getting good conversion rates</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/goodui-newsletter-ideas-getting-good-conversion-rates/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/goodui-newsletter-ideas-getting-good-conversion-rates/</guid><description>Jakub Linowski, creator of Wireframes Magazine just started writing a newsletter called Good UI on how to design sites that are easy to use and also yield high conversion rates.
He's looking at how to employ practical ideas that satisfy the business side as well as the people using it, which I'm sure is something we all want to do on sites that sell a product or service. He plans to publish the newsletter monthly.</description></item><item><title>IPEVO Ziggi Review</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/ipevo-ziggi-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/ipevo-ziggi-review/</guid><description>Have you ever done the dance of holding a sketch up to your computer's webcam or taken pictures of them with your iPhone to email to yourself or to colleagues? I've done that sort of thing for all of the years that I've worked remotely on design and development teams, because scanners get tired real fast. Frustrated with this process, I had largely given up, until a few months ago when I was looking for tools to share work on paper between students and teachers.</description></item><item><title>Your app is a collection of tiny details</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</guid><description>"Getting the details right is the difference between something that delights, and something customers tolerate."
&amp;#8212;Jeff Atwood
I didn't read Jeff Atwood's article about cat feeders right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It's also a terrific demonstration of what he's saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to satisfice with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Realizing Empathy: An Inquiry into the Meaning of Making</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/realizing-empathy-inquiry-meaning-making/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/realizing-empathy-inquiry-meaning-making/</guid><description>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn't understand. He went to art school.</description></item><item><title>Omnigraffle Stencil for Twitter Bootstrap 2</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/omnigraffle-stencil-twitter-bootstrap-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/omnigraffle-stencil-twitter-bootstrap-2/</guid><description>The team at Viget have created a free OmniGraffle stencil for designing interfaces with Twitter Bootstrap.

They're interested in telling the less obvious human stories of creativity, passion and hard work that hide behind every interface.
The first issue includes conversations with web standards wizard Dan Cederholm, all-round-talent Drew Wilson, former last.fm design lead Hannah Donovan, 37signals' designer and product manager Ryan Singer, design entrepreneur Andrew Wilkinson and pixel-perfectionist Benjamin de Cock.</description></item><item><title>Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/design-fundamental-soul-human-made-creation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/design-fundamental-soul-human-made-creation/</guid><description>Adam Pritzker deftly combined this image of an Apple I and this Steve Jobs quote on design from an interview in 2000 that appeared in Fortune.
“In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.</description></item><item><title>Letting Go</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/letting-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/letting-go/</guid><description>Two great slides from Yiibu's presentation, Letting Go, a talk about design in an time of increasing disruption.
"Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don't necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve."

Small software and web startups value and are able to use a broader range of skillsets, because one of the highest priorities, especially for bootstrapped startups, is to ship while lean on resources.
Jared notes that those who don't think designers should know how to code say this dilutes the designer's value.</description></item><item><title>Have a nice day</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/have-nice-day/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/have-nice-day/</guid><description>Don't let anyone tell you that the tools you choose are wrong or inappropriate. Find the right design and keep winning.
Occasionally I'm asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I'm familiar with.</description></item></channel></rss>
