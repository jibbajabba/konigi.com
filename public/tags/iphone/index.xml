He covers the deliverables you'll be expected to produce, outlines the constraints of the medium, and introduces fundamental iOS and UI design concepts.

Whitelines is one of my favorite sketch paper makers. They make great graph paper that reverses the grid using white lines over pale a gray paper. The result is that the grid it more subtle and less distracting
The Whitelines Link product is a free iPhone app that let's you capture sketches made on their new Whitelines Link papers.</description></item><item><title>Phonedoo: Dry erase iPhone sketching</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/phonedoo-dry-erase-iphone-sketching/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/phonedoo-dry-erase-iphone-sketching/</guid><description>Cohdoo makes a nice iPhone UI sketching product called Phone Doos. They are 6.8&amp;quot; by 3.5&amp;quot; dry erase iPhone surfaces with faint grid lines and magnetic backing. A pack contains 10 Phone Doos.
I like that these gives you a surface to work on that can be re-arranged easily on a table and presented on a metallic wall. They have some good screenshots using them arranged on a whiteboard with flow arrows pointing between them, which is another thing that's probably much easier with these as opposed to using paper.</description></item><item><title>iPad Dry Erase Board</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-dry-erase-board/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-dry-erase-board/</guid><description>New sketching goodies hit the shelves at UI Stencils, from our good friends Design Commission. They've created an iPad dry erase board with dot grid, and updated their awesome iPhone sticky pads. Definitely want to get my hands on the dry erase board.
Update:
Mine arrived and I have to say that this is the nicest dry erase board I have now. It's made on hard particle board, similar to what you'd find on a clipboard, so it feels great in the hands.</description></item><item><title>Word Lens: Translation using Augmented Reality</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/word-lens-translation-using-augmented-reality/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/word-lens-translation-using-augmented-reality/</guid><description>This is one of the most practical uses of augmented reality I've seen. Word Lens translates text you capture from an iPhone's camera to another language. I think it's only Spanish-English/English-Spanish at the moment, and $4.99 per language. If you're skeptical, as some YouTubers seem to be in the comments, you can see an example of the translation I did on my phone of an English magazine page to Spanish.</description></item><item><title>Review: Sync design comps to iPhone</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/review-sync-design-comps-iphone/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/review-sync-design-comps-iphone/</guid><description>Review is a simple app to review your visual design comps on the iPhone.

I bought it before it was acquired by Autodesk from Alias, mostly for art work, but also to experiment with it as a tool for interface sketching. But while I wanted to use it more, I find myself falling back on paper and pencil almost all of the time. Autodesk recently released iPhone versions of the app (1 version is free, and the full version is $2.</description></item></channel></rss>
