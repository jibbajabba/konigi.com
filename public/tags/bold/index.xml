      <description>Brown &amp;amp; White launches the new site for rock band The Pineapple Thief to promote their 8th studio album. The whole site was built on the wordpress platformâ€¦ oh and almost forgot to mention the album art was designed by the legendary Storm Thorgerson.

      <description>The Gatorade site redesign accompanies the drink maker&#39;s rebranding and the bold type of the product names on every bottle. Every drink name is an active message about excelling in sports and the video loop that runs in the background of product and athlete pages suffuses the site with the imagery of athletes kicking ass. A product filter allows users to view by product name or nutritient.

      <description>Randjelovic Milos&#39;s portfolio really can&#39;t be capture very well in screenshots, so you should check out the site to experience the perfect transitions between pages. Beautiful bold type and simple presentation.

      <description>The redesigned IDEO site has been sitting in a browser tab for a few weeks now because it just felt like one of those things I needed to mull over before writing about. It&#39;s one of the few sites this year that just took me by surprise. In short, the deep treasure trove of content unleashed in this redesign is a huge departure from the tightly constrained and minimalist prior design.</description>

      <description>The Heads of State are a 2 person design studio in Brooklyn and Seattle. Their recently redesigned site showcases the strong portfolio of print work on projects including book covers, magazine illustrations, and corporate identity. I love the simple, powerful covers on the Rosenfeld Media books, and after diving into their site, I think I&#39;d love even more to hire them in the future.

      <description>What could be more appropriate for a font foundry than to use its own large, capitalized type as the focus, form, and interface for the design. 25TM is modern, minimalist, and makes its statement firmly&amp;#8212;type is the message, period.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/designs/national-television/</guid>
      <description>National Television is a video and film production studio in California. It&#39;s portfolio site is among the best examples of the use of bold typography as the primary element that defines both the form and interface. The look is clean and undeniably confident.

      <description>Big bold typography that functions as navigation, full screen photography that functions as backdrop, a simple message, and a lasting product that does justice to live music performances and the people who love them.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/daisy-balloon/</guid>
      <description>Daisy is an artist that does incredible things with balloons. The site presently shows some amazing dresses fabricated with the long balloons you&#39;d usually only see in the form of little animals, but Daisy elevates the art to design amazing clothing that could be called haute couture. I could easily imagine these things being made out of a less ephemeral material and being worn, albeit a bit uncomfortably.</description>
