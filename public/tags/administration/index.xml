      <description>WordPress added some excellent layout customization options on administration screens in version 2.7. The most obvious change comes in the form of the Screen Options tab, which expands a settings panel that let&#39;s the admin hide or show parts of the UI being viewed, and saves those settings for the user immediately. The UI also provides a drag and drop behavior to re-arrange modules. When hovering over a module heading, the icon turns into a full hand and lets the user move modules up or down in the column, or between columns.</description>

      <description>The redesign of the AIGA content management system by Happy Cog and Naz Hamid is easily one of the nicest looking CMS admin experiences I&#39;ve ever seen screen shots of. Neutral background colors are easy on the eyes. There&#39;s great attention being paid to the details. Icons are well designed and clear, forms are laid out well, everything is perfectly aligned, and page elements direct the user through every facet of administration.</description>
