      <description>Hannah Donovan&amp;rsquo;s essay in A List Apart considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.
I&#39;ve been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement.</description>

      <description>I just started reading What Makes Them Click, Susan Weinschenk&amp;rsquo;s blog for people who want to learn how to apply psychology to understand how people think, work, and relate.
&amp;quot;The blog focuses especially on applying the latest research in psychology to make you more effective, be more successful at your work and in your career, and get to know better why you and the people around you do what you do.</description>

      <description>Harry Brignull quotes a passage from Susan Marks&amp;rsquo; Finding Betty Crocker to tell the story of how the cake mix maker used a clever bit of imagination about the process of using their product to give customers the feeling of playing a desirable role&amp;ndash;that of home-maker and cook. They did this by simply requiring that real eggs be used in making cakes, rather than incorporating powered egg, and marketed this as a benefit.</description>

      <title>Barry Schwartz on the Paradox of Choice</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/barry-schwartz-paradox-choice/</link>

      <description>Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.
The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way.</description>

      <title>Realizations of Rounded Rectangles</title>

      <description>Plasq designer, Keith Lang, recounts the story from computer folklore of how the rounded rectangle came to dominate the Mac OS, and discusses its effect on visual cognition. He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of Visual Perception to offer his opinion.
A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle.</description>
