&amp;quot;The interactive sketching notation is an emerging visual language which affords the representation of interface states and event-based user actions. Through a few simple and standardized rules, what the user sees (drawn in greys and blacks) and does (drawn in red) are unified into a coherent sketching system. This unification of both interface and use, intends to enable designers to tell more powerful stories of interaction.</description></item><item><title>Touch Notation</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/touch-notation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/touch-notation/</guid><description>Touch Notation is a simple annotation system created by Matt Gemmell for documenting multi-touch gestures. It's an incredibly simple system when compared to the more literal annotation symbols that use hands, because the symbology can be quickly rendered in sketches as well as being used in wireframing libraries.
The Touch Notation page provides PSD, AI, and OmniGraffle templates. I've additionally created a Balsamiq Mockups version of the system on Mockups To Go.</description></item><item><title>Annotating Specs With Tracing Paper</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/annotating-specs-tracing-paper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/annotating-specs-tracing-paper/</guid><description>Donna Lichaw posted a photo showing a nice method for annotating specs using tracing paper or vellum.

YouTube is not the first to add media annotations or commenting features like this, but the addition of this feature may mean we'll see more if it on video portals. The feature is similar to the video annotation that Bubbleply does. Viewers are not allowed to add annotations to other users' media as is done on Flickr and iminlikewithyou.</description></item><item><title>i'minlikewithyou Comments</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/iminlikewithyou-comments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/iminlikewithyou-comments/</guid><description>i'minlikewithyou's full Flash interface pushes the boundaries of what can be done with user interfaces in terms of social interaction. The comment feature on the site's news articles and videos allows users to place comments (including a drawing) over the media. In the case of video, the comments appear briefly on top of the video at the points where people have placed them. Because of the volume of commenting on these videos, tons of comments will roll by in a frenzied flash, so it's hard to read them all.</description></item></channel></rss>
