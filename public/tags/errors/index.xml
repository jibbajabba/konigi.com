      <description>Smashing Magazine expound upon what makes a well designed 404 page in their latest design gallery which features 50 examples. Inspired by the gallery, I made a more useful 404 for Konigi as well.

      <description>Luke Wroblewski pointed to Josh Bush&#39;s Masked Input Plugin for JQuery. Luke writes that the plugin &#34;integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin.&#34;</description>

      <title>Why Fail Safe When You Can Poka-yoke?</title>

      <description>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for &#34;fail-safing&#34; that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:
Poka-yoke (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means &#34;fail-safing&#34;, &#34;Foolproof&#34; or &#34;mistake-proofing&#34; â€” avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation.</description>

      <title>Facebook Loses Users&#39; Email Notification Settings</title>

      <description>I got this in my email from Facebook. Unfortunately, the settings that control which email notifications get sent to you were lost. We&#39;re sorry for the inconvenience.
 Wow. Really? I agree with what M. David Peterson had to say about the issue. Sounds like they&#39;ve got some inexperienced engineers running the show. If this had been a web service with critical data that wasn&#39;t backed up, people would be pretty pissed.</description>
