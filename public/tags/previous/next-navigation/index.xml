Each gallery shows large beveled previous/next buttons above and below the photo, with a [current photo]/[total photos] indicator above. Below, a strip of thumbnails shows the full list of images in the gallery. An indicator of the current photo in that strip, e.g. with a special border treatment would ice the cake.

The most common method for paging through a series of items is to show a carousel on the main pages, with prev/next arrow icons to shuffle through sets of 3-4. On special featured modules with larger poster image thumbnails they use coverflow with their hybrid scrollbar which has arrows that increment one item at a time, or allow you to scroll to move through larger increments.</description></item><item><title>MSNBC Spectra Visual Newsreader Carousel</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/msnbc-spectra-visual-newsreader-carousel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/msnbc-spectra-visual-newsreader-carousel/</guid><description>MSNBC.com's Spectra Visual Newsreader provides an interesting way of visually presenting channels of content from the massive news site. Adding channels drops media cards into the screen and rotates them in a 3D carousel. Below the vortext of cards, a hybrid pagination scrollbar, which bests Apple's concept, allows the user to select cards to view one at a time. Previous/Next arrows allow linear progression. A helpful [current card]/[total cards] indicator is shown on the scroll bar.</description></item><item><title>Issuu Pagination</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/issuu-pagination/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/issuu-pagination/</guid><description>Issuu is an online self-publishing service that allows users to create e-magazines and books that are displayed in their slick Flash reader. The service also provides social features around the content. One of the nicest things about the reader is the usable pagination. The reader features the typical next/previous and jump to page features you'd find in an ebook or PDF reader. They also provide some features that are similar to the browsing experience with Preview, the Dock, and QuickLook in the Mac, utilizing miniature thumbnails of pages to scroll through pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
