Once a website is posted on Concept Feedback, members are invited to provide reviews. On average, a concept receives 12 or more unique reviews, while some can generate as many as 100. Because of the nature of the community, feedback can cover a variety of topics, including design, usability, content and strategy. Concept Feedback is best for getting design-related feedback from a wide audience and can be used at all stages of development.</description></item><item><title>Roberto Gadotti</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/roberto-gadotti/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/roberto-gadotti/</guid><description>http://www.robertogadotti.it/</description></item><item><title>Silverado Vineyards</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/silverado-vineyards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/silverado-vineyards/</guid><description>Silverado Vineyards celebrates a new Flash website with an interactive vineyard map and gorgeous photo galleries on most wine, tours, and tasting pages to bring visitors to the heart of Sonoma County, online.
