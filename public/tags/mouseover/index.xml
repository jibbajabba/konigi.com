They've used their quick-loading, shadowed mouseover call outs for years now and they've always felt very useful to me and effortless to deal with. They're always available, and even work in areas you might not expect to see them, like in a recommendation list within a lightbox dialog. The mouseovers even make up for some things that I feel are design shortcomings, like the lack of a feature to show a gallery of poster images or sort by genre in the instant play queue.</description></item></channel></rss>
