      <description>The video details shown on mouseover in Netflix is one of those behaviors I just take for granted now. They&#39;ve used their quick-loading, shadowed mouseover call outs for years now and they&#39;ve always felt very useful to me and effortless to deal with. They&#39;re always available, and even work in areas you might not expect to see them, like in a recommendation list within a lightbox dialog. The mouseovers even make up for some things that I feel are design shortcomings, like the lack of a feature to show a gallery of poster images or sort by genre in the instant play queue.</description>
