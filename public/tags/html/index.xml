      <description>Semantic UI is a framework for building HTML sites that aims at creating a system based on semantic naming and sensible defaults.
The framework compares itself directly with Bootstrap. It uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements. Interface definitions are tag ambivalent so you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/making-infield-form-labels-suck-less/</guid>
      <description>Jackson Fox and Jeremy Fields did an excellent 2-part write on the use of &#34;infield&#34; labels at Viget. There are several techniques for placing labels inside the input box. For varying reasons we may want to avoid the label on top or side positioning, but as Jackson points out, the infield placement can be problematic. Part 1 talks about the problems using infield labels. Part 2 shows how they deal with the problem by using a visible tooltip that doesn&#39;t obscure the input, with a jsFiddle snippet to play with the code.</description>

I was playing around with static html tools for a little side project I&#39;ve been toying with. I was tinkering with Stacey and Kirby. Awesome tools for static PHP page building.</description>

      <description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description>

Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq&amp;rsquo;s site.

      <description>Quplo may be the most promising HTML prototyping tools I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for UX designers who know a little HTML and would like to do HTML prototyping, but either don&amp;rsquo;t have the chops to build the interaction by hand, or are lazy like me.
The web-based tool allows you to build multiple prototypes using a combination of standard HTML/CSS. If you can do JS, the standard JS libraries are available to include in your pages (or sheets in Quplo lingo).</description>

The graph below shows a snapshot of current support and intent to support in web browsers. Shows that IE is well behind the field in terms of readiness as we speak, but IE 9 intends to support.</description>

Matt summarizes what he believes:
As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making.</description>

      <description>Drawter has been sitting in my tabs for a few days now, and I keep coming back to play with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website&#39;s code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div&#39;s style properties within floating inspectors.</description>
