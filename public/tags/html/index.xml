The framework compares itself directly with Bootstrap. It uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements. Interface definitions are tag ambivalent so you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element.

There are several techniques for placing labels inside the input box. For varying reasons we may want to avoid the label on top or side positioning, but as Jackson points out, the infield placement can be problematic. Part 1 talks about the problems using infield labels. Part 2 shows how they deal with the problem by using a visible tooltip that doesn't obscure the input, with a jsFiddle snippet to play with the code.</description></item><item><title>Mixture</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/mixture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/mixture/</guid><description>Mixture is a rapid prototyping and static site generation tool for Mac and Windows.

The thing that has been doing it for me lately is working with static html on some of my smaller production sites.
I was playing around with static html tools for a little side project I've been toying with. I was tinkering with Stacey and Kirby. Awesome tools for static PHP page building.</description></item><item><title>jKit: jQuery based UI Toolkit</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/jkit-jquery-based-ui-toolkit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/jkit-jquery-based-ui-toolkit/</guid><description>jKit is a cross platform, jQuery based UI toolkit, that's small in size and is simple enough for non-programmers to use.

Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description></item><item><title>Wirefy: Responsive Wireframe Library</title><link>https://konigi.com/links/wirefy-responsive-wireframe-library/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/links/wirefy-responsive-wireframe-library/</guid><description>Wirefy is a collection of CSS and JS files for creating responsive HTML wireframes.
