Because every time you make a powerpoint, Edward Tufte kills a kitten... and David Byrne does a happy dance.
I love how the cats run off the side of the canvas. Oh, and how no one in that meeting is paying attention... Awesome.

Their description:
We create concept maps, a type of model, to explore and learn about complex information spaces. By showing everything—the forest and the trees—in a single view, concept maps help people create mental models and clarify thoughts. We create concept maps to share understanding—with our clients, peers, and others interested in the subjects.
Their gallery of downloadable PDF posters include the creative process, play, innovation, and much more.</description></item><item><title>Feltron 2008 Annual Report</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/feltron-2008-annual-report/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/feltron-2008-annual-report/</guid><description>Nick Felton's annual report continues to take mundane data and meticulously render superb stastical diagrams and information graphics. If every corporate Power Point chart looked this good, fewer people would be bored out of their skulls in meetings.
