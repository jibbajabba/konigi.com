The service also provides social features around the content. One of the nicest things about the reader is the usable pagination. The reader features the typical next/previous and jump to page features you'd find in an ebook or PDF reader. They also provide some features that are similar to the browsing experience with Preview, the Dock, and QuickLook in the Mac, utilizing miniature thumbnails of pages to scroll through pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
