Huge pixelated text and pointers, dinging mouseovers that make you half expect coins to pop out of links, and a keyboard navigation make this site a pleasure for NES nostalgists.

Simple grid and nice use of expand/collapse transitions in places.

Every drink name is an active message about excelling in sports and the video loop that runs in the background of product and athlete pages suffuses the site with the imagery of athletes kicking ass. A product filter allows users to view by product name or nutritient.

Not suprisingly, they have one of the best looking conference sites to set the stage, showcasing the speakers and event. The treatment of the slash motif morphing into the trapezoids repeated throughout the site in the photography is cool. I like the dark bold color treatment and the clean hierarchy in tables, forms, and text.</description></item><item><title>Anaara Media LLC</title><link>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/anaara-media-llc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/anaara-media-llc/</guid><description>The website of RIA company Anaara Media LLC has an interesting flash interface which makes use of expanding cards to present its content.

Simple linear navigation arrows above the screenshots to switch project, and to the sides of the project screens to shuffle through the slideshow. Below is a brief describing the project.

Big type and ample white space sets up a very clear visual hierarchy and makes it easy to read, and a strong center alignment of header/footer elements directs the eye. I love the big illustrated robot head in the header (kind of expecting it to wink at me) and the character photos in the footer. I also like the way the global navigation shifts so that the center link is whatever section you're viewing, which makes that centered look and directs your eyes downwards.</description></item></channel></rss>
