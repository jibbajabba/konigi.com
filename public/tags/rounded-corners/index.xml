I noticed, however, that they kept the slight (3px?) rounding of names in the To: field of the messaging section. That somehow feels like a natural place for an exception to rounding corners for some reason. You know, so you don't get impaled when backspacing in the field. Kidding. This is a quote from their announcement.</description></item></channel></rss>
