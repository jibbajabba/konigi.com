      <title>AniJS: Declarative handling library for CSS animations</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/links/anijs-declarative-handling-library-css-animations/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/anijs-declarative-handling-library-css-animations/</guid>
      <description>AniJS is a library for CSS animations that allows you to write simple statements for handling animation as key/value pairs in html data attributes. It feels very close to writing natural language statements, in a format that is a bit more familiar in code than writing sentences. A simple example contains IF, ON, DO, and TO pairs and would look like this: &amp;lt;input id=&#34;name&#34; type=&#34;text&#34; data-anijs=&#34;if: focus, do: wobble, to: p&#34;</description>

      <description>uilang is a minimal, ui-focused programming language for web designers that handles click events, primarily for toggling classes and css display properties. I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on &#34;.try-it&#34; toggles class &#34;hidden&#34; on &#34;.info-box&#34;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that&#39;s a plus if you don&#39;t want or need someone else&#39;s implementation of those things.</description>

      <description>Semantic UI is a framework for building HTML sites that aims at creating a system based on semantic naming and sensible defaults.
The framework compares itself directly with Bootstrap. It uses simple, common language for parts of interface elements and familiar rules used in natural languages for describing elements. Interface definitions are tag ambivalent so you can use div, article, section, span without affecting the display of the element.

There is a technique using a special attribute that even allows you to inject behaviors without writing javascript. It has commonly used design patterns, and nice techniques for content templating and binding to cover the basics of UI prototypes.

      <description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description>

Occasionally I&#39;m asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I&#39;m familiar with.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/wirify-create-wireframes-web-pages/</guid>
      <description>Wirify is a bookmarklet that lets you turn any web page into a wireframe in one click. Similar to the Web Without Words, it converts all of the elements on a web page to gray boxes, so you can visualize the page as a schematic without content.  This reminds me of a a technique used in painting and design where one steps back a distance from the canvas or screen and blurs the eyes to get a view of the placement of parts of the design, the relationship of the parts to each other, the white space, and the hierarchy of elements.</description>

Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq&amp;rsquo;s site.
HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites.</description>

The web-based tool allows you to build multiple prototypes using a combination of standard HTML/CSS. If you can do JS, the standard JS libraries are available to include in your pages (or sheets in Quplo lingo).</description>

Matt summarizes what he believes:
As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making.</description>

This is an interesting looking tool that lets you create HTML wireframes using a web interface. You specify your grid, then insert one of the pre-defined UI components into the page. An inspector lets you modify the component attributes. There isn&amp;rsquo;t any information about who is responsible for this tool and if it&amp;rsquo;s merely an experiment or a demo of something we can expect to see in an application or framework.</description>

      <description>Drawter has been sitting in my tabs for a few days now, and I keep coming back to play with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website&#39;s code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div&#39;s style properties within floating inspectors.</description>

      <description>Zen Coding is plugin for HTML editors that allows you to use shorthand to generate HTML. I twas created and supported by Sergey Chikuyonok for Aptana, TextMate, Coda and Espresso. It is based on JavaScript (for Aptana) or Python (the rest of all) script and using more advanced Zen HTML Selectors logic for building HTML. The demo video below shows Zen Coding in action.

      <description>As you may know, I&#39;ve been working on an html prototyping toolkit that&#39;s in its infancy, and available to play with in pre-release form here on Konigi. What you also may know is that I hope to put the code in a repository so that people can contribute UI component markup/css/js to it, but what I&#39;ve got is not mature enough yet.
A few people have already started sharing their ideas and tips with me and I&#39;ve felt like it&#39;s kind of a waste to have some of these discussions happen offline, so I want to step out and start these discussions in a wider venue.</description>

      <description>ixEdit is a JavaScript-based interaction design tool for the web. With IxEdit, designers can practice DOM-scripting without coding to change, add, move, or transform elements dynamically on your web pages. It&amp;rsquo;s specifically designed for HTML prototyping and allows designers to build interactive interfaces directly in the browser, and provides the code to copy and paste into the HTML page. Works with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or IE. Watch the video below to see how it works.</description>

      <description>This is a demo of an HTML Prototyping Toolkit that I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled from a few open source libraries. The idea is to create something super light so you can sketch your wireframes in HTML.
Using Templates I&amp;rsquo;m using a jQuery template for creating columns in a grid. Columns look like this:

 {cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; grid layout container {col12} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column {/col} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; closed column {col12last} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column last in container {/col} {/cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; end of container  You can try out the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;m playing with here:</description>

      <description>Simon Collison writes about the different forms of prototyping in ErskineLabs&amp;rsquo; Process Toolbox, describing the benefits of paper, wireframe, and browser prototypes.
As much as all parties may talk about requirements and argue over features, often they won’t really “get it” until they can see the concept represented visually, and understand its exact behaviour. This brings us on to various methods of prototyping.

      <title>What&#39;s broken about wireframes and how can we fix them?</title>

      <description>Generally speaking I have 2 gripes with wireframes. One is that they&#39;re very limited and come with issues in terms of communicating design. Secondly, they&#39;re not fast and flexible enough as communication artifacts.
HTML wireframes and prototypes provide some relief from some of the issues, and I&#39;d like to hear what other people are looking for when doing HTML wireframes in order to fix and overcome the limitations of wireframes made in graphics software.</description>

      <description>Napkee is a very exciting tool that extends the quick and easy wireframing process in Balsamiq Mockups by importing your Balsamiq files and generating interactive prototypes in Flex or HTML version.
To start off, you build your series of wireframes in Mockups, optionally creating links between pages. The screenshot below shows a wireframe of a fictional news site I created to try it out. I mocked up a site home page, and a login screen for my test.</description>
