The biggest problem I've had is that after I take a screenshot, I often want to do something with it. I can do this by just getting Cloud to watch and upload files passively, but I've always wanted to save to my own server after just issuing one command to capture the page.</description></item><item><title>Bounce: Screenshot annotation service</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/bounce-screenshot-annotation-service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/bounce-screenshot-annotation-service/</guid><description>Bounce is a new screen capture service from Zurb that lets you invite other collaborators to annotate screenshots.

The software allows you to capture the screen, audio and iSight input, and provides simple drag and drop editing including a lot of built-in transitions and effects. You can then easily export the HTML and SWF for embedding in a web page. Looks like an easy to use alternative that might take the work out of producing screencasts.</description></item><item><title>Screenr Screencasting Service</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/screenr-screencasting-service/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/screenr-screencasting-service/</guid><description>Screenr is a web-based screen capture tool that lets you record screen video and audio from your Mac or PC and posts a link to the video, hosted on Screenr.com, to your Twitter stream.

Userfly is a new web-based usability testing service that looks pretty exciting. When you set up a new test on the service, you're given JavaScript to enter into your site template. Userfly captures sessions including link clicks and time spent on the page, and records screen events including mouse movement and keystrokes.

Some are great for a quick and dirty capture of a page I want to send someone. Others are good for annotating an interface I want to post to a web page. And still others are best for archival screen capture or for interfaces with video. Below are the 6 screenshot utilities that Mac users should know about.</description></item></channel></rss>
