The Design Has to be Original People Read People Know What They Like Design Always with Implementation in Mind Can’t Decide? Make it a Preference If you Have Great Search, You Don’t Need Great Information Architecture UX Design Stops at the Edges of the Product Design to Avoid Clicks People Don’t Change If the Design is a Good One, You Don’t Need to Test It Some of these become so ingrained, that it takes a lot of effort to convince clients or colleagues otherwise.</description></item></channel></rss>
