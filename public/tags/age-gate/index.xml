The beautiful large type on the off-white paper reminds me of letterpress cards.
One thing I loved immediately was the age gate, which asks you when you were born so you can get through to shop for wine.
Not only is the big text for the month/day/year picker friendly, but that goofy headlines and &amp;quot;When were you last born?&amp;quot; copy is hilarious, if you catch the joke.</description></item></channel></rss>
