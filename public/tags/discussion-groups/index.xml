What you also may know is that I hope to put the code in a repository so that people can contribute UI component markup/css/js to it, but what I've got is not mature enough yet.
A few people have already started sharing their ideas and tips with me and I've felt like it's kind of a waste to have some of these discussions happen offline, so I want to step out and start these discussions in a wider venue.</description></item></channel></rss>
