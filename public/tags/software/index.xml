      <description>Frontify looks like an interesting SaaS product for design teams. It provides collaborative features for getting design feedback, creating specifications, documentation and style guides, and linking pages together.
The commenting and linking features are what you&#39;d expect, but what I was really impressed with are the measures, colors, and typography tools for generating style guides. Very nicely done. There are additional capabilities for code export &amp;amp; integration with their API.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve release Mockups 2.0 at Balsamiq. The main feature in this release is the Symbols functionality. It allows you to reuse groups of controls in order to create templates, page masters, and libraries of re-usable components. This can be done globally for all of your projects, or locally within a single project. You can create symbols from the top down and the bottom up. There&#39;s some documentation for this somewhat advanced feature here: Working with Symbols.</description>

      <description>The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness.
Peldi pointed me to a video of Kathy Sierra&#39;s presentation at Business of Software 09, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It&#39;s about user benefits, and not features--about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.</description>

      <title>Treejack - Information architecture testing</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/links/treejack-information-architecture-testing/</guid>
      <description>Treejack is a tool to help you test the effectiveness of an information architecture.&amp;nbsp; Use it to find out which categories are strong, which labels need tweaking and what tasks people are struggling with.&amp;nbsp; Because you can upload an existing or proposed IA, and test with participants remotely, you get rapid feedback at a fraction of the cost of in-person testing.
Often, usability testing only reveals flaws with the interaction and interface elements.</description>
