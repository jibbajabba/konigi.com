      <description>This seems the ideal solution for my iPad sketching needs. A few days ago, when I thought of hacking my Pogo Sketch, I started researching all of the options for creating my own drawing tool for the iPad&amp;rsquo;s capacitive touch screen, and was researching the styli that were available. I came across the odd design of the iClooly and thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out of curiosity.
I had low expectations, but was surprised by how well it works for iPad sketching.</description>
