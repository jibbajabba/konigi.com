      <description>Engadget&#39;s comment rating and karma system uses +1/-1 voting, so users can vote comments up or down. Votes below a certain threshold get dimmed out rather than hidden. When a vote is applied, the user&#39;s vote is registered, a message appears, and the voting controls are hidden. To the right, there&#39;s an exclamation mark to flag inappropriate comments, which are then immediately collapsed from view.

      <description>Yahoo! Buzz pulls actively viewed and shared pages from its portal and puts them in a Digg-like interface with vote-to-promote buttons so users may actively push stories up and down the Buzz list. The digg/bury interface is simple. Stories are categorized by several main topic areas, and users may view the stories with the highest vote count, over several time slices, or sorted by recency.
1. When the user visits the site the first time, a guided tour jumps the user around the page to introduce them to the site&#39;s features.</description>
