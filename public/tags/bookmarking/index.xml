Love the random sort option, and the staggered placement of the gallery of images which feels like an installation of paintings on a gallery wall.

The readbag bookmarking service (it's actually a Google App Engine application) provides the functionality to do one thing very well--bookmark pages that you want to read for later.
Now you might argue that you can use any social bookmarking service to do this, or something like Evernote.</description></item></channel></rss>
