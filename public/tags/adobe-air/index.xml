User Interface Library (YUI) that allows users to create and group custom queries by topics of interest, as well as view topic trends. Very nicely done. Am looking at at how the advanced search works at the moment. Looks very easy to build up an seems like it might be the perfect app for a lurker or follower who doesn't post much.</description></item><item><title>DestroyFlickr</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/destroyflickr/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/destroyflickr/</guid><description>Tina pointed to DestroyFlickr, an excellent AIR application for viewing Flickr photos.
DestroyFlickr explores alternative methods for viewing and sharing Flickr content. Its user interface provides an environment that benefits photos rather than hindering them. With the ability to look at a photo on a dark, neutral background, you can view it without the interference of a brighter surrounding. By using workspaces and canvases, DestroyFlickr is able to retain a constant history of where you have navigated, offering the ability to revisit an area without the need to reload the entire page.</description></item></channel></rss>
