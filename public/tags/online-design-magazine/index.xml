In the past two years we grew to be the biggest design weblog in the Netherlands. We left the traditional weblog format behind us and chose for an online design magazine, with custom designed specials like interviews, book reviews and event reports. Go have a look and read about us below. For more information, questions and high-res imagery, contact us at info@fontanel.</description></item></channel></rss>
