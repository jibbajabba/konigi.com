Visualize a glass of Fuqua or Niederberger's best, or, if you're feeling prime time, maybe a glass of pink from their Melrose vineyard, and enjoy their new website :).</description></item><item><title>MILLIMETER/MILLIGRAM</title><link>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/millimetermilligram/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/millimetermilligram/</guid><description>I like the minimalist design.

They're a clothing and accessories company that aims at providing products with materials and construction that are meant to last and can be handed down to others for reuse.
