Luke writes that the plugin "integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin."</description></item><item><title>Why Fail Safe When You Can Poka-yoke?</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/why-fail-safe-when-you-can-poka-yoke/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/why-fail-safe-when-you-can-poka-yoke/</guid><description>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for "fail-safing" that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:
Poka-yoke (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means "fail-safing", "Foolproof" or "mistake-proofing" â€” avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation.</description></item></channel></rss>
