      <description>The devil runs UX workshops for idle hands, and he comes up with bad features. This is Des Traynor&amp;rsquo;s lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic.

      <description>A group of 99u attendees had a visit with Ben Kaufman, the CEO/founder of product development company Quirky, who gave us a look into how his company uses crowd-sourcing to deliver products. Here are some of my notes from that visit. More 99u notes to follow.
Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case.</description>

      <description>Will Wright&amp;rsquo;s talk at the Summit on Science, Entertainment, and Education looks at how game play can be relevant to education. These are my notes from this talk.
How we process information Our basic model for processing and acting on data that we receive in the world looks something like this:

      <title>Marian Bantjes: Intricate beauty by design on TED</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/marian-bantjes-intricate-beauty-design-ted/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/marian-bantjes-intricate-beauty-design-ted/</guid>
      <description>Marian Bantjes gives a fantastic TED talk, where she discusses her work as a graphic artist living outside the mainstream of design thinking, thinking about ethereal qualities like bringing joy, invoking wonder, and inciting curiosity. This bit excited me:
The more I deal with the work as something of my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is as something that is compelling, interesting, and sustaining.</description>

      <description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t get to the IA Summit this year? Or went to IAS10, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see everything in all the tracks? Of course you didn&amp;rsquo;t unless you had Hermione&amp;rsquo;s Time Turner with you.
The good news is that Jeff Parks did an amazing job of capturing the sessions and producing audio podcasts, which are now available via Boxes and Arrows or by subscribing to the podcast via iTunes. Currently the keynotes and all of the sessions from Day 1 are available.</description>

      <title>Bill Buxton on Innovation and the Long Nose Theory</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/bill-buxton-innovation-and-long-nose-theory/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/bill-buxton-innovation-and-long-nose-theory/</guid>
      <description>Bolt|Peters summarizes Bill Buxton&amp;rsquo;s talk at CHI 2008, which is focussed largely around his theory of long nose. The article in BusinessWeek describes the danger of trying to innovate around the long tail theory alone, and attempts to create awareness for this other phenomenon which he calls the long nose. The theory describes how the bulk of innovation is low-amplitude and takes place over a long period of time. [T]he bulk of innovation behind the latest &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; moment (multi-touch on the iPhone, for example) is also low-amplitude and takes place over a long period—but well before the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; idea has become generally known, much less reached the tipping point.</description>
