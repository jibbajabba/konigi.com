      <description>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn&#39;t understand. He went to art school.</description>

      <title>Where Good Ideas Come From, by Steven Johnson</title>

      <description>Chance favors the connected mind.
I just picked up Steven Berlin Johnson&#39;s Where Good Ideas Come From after watching this sketch-note summarization of the ideas in the book.
 I became a fan of Steven&#39;s after reading the New Yorker article &#34;Watching TV Makes you Smarter&#34; and his book, Everything Bad is Good for You. This one looks like it will be an interesting read. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s full of stories of long drawn out infancy of ideas, and the collisions and connections that make ideas succeed.</description>

      <description>Rosenfeld Media have a book site and Ning community up for John Ferrara&#39;s forthcoming book, Playful Design: Creating Game Expderiences in Everyday Interfaces.
Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they&#39;re siblings that grew up in different houses. They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design.</description>
