After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn't understand. He went to art school.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Design Pattern Gallery</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/mobile-design-pattern-gallery/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/mobile-design-pattern-gallery/</guid><description>Theresa Neil's forthcoming book, Mobile Design Pattern Gallery, is set to be released by O'Reilly in the Fall of 2011.

I just picked up Steven Berlin Johnson's Where Good Ideas Come From after watching this sketch-note summarization of the ideas in the book.
I became a fan of Steven's after reading the New Yorker article "Watching TV Makes you Smarter" and his book, Everything Bad is Good for You. This one looks like it will be an interesting read. I'm hoping it's full of stories of long drawn out infancy of ideas, and the collisions and connections that make ideas succeed.</description></item><item><title>Speak Human: The new book from Eric Karjaluoto</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/speak-human-new-book-eric-karjaluoto/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/speak-human-new-book-eric-karjaluoto/</guid><description>smashLab's Eric Karjaluoto writes about outmarketing the big guys by getting personal in his book Speak Human.

Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they're siblings that grew up in different houses. They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design.</description></item><item><title>Printed books on User Experience free to read online</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/printed-books-user-experience-free-read-online/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/printed-books-user-experience-free-read-online/</guid><description>UX Bookmark lists a few printed UX books that are available to read for free online, including the following.

It looks beautiful. Organized in three sections, "Rough," "Refined," and "Random" (plus bonus section "Revealed," where O'Donnell shows the thumbnail sketches he used to lay out the book), almost all sketches/sketchbook pages are pared with pictures of the finished product side by side. The "Rough" section features loose artwork and thick lines, but crisp final products, like the way Jason Munn turns simple sketches into iconic music posters, while the "</description></item><item><title>A Project Guide to UX Design</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/project-guide-ux-design/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/project-guide-ux-design/</guid><description>The companion site to the book, Project Guide to UX Design: For User Experience Designers in the Field or in the Making, by authors Russ Unger &amp;amp; Carolyn Chandler contains additional reference materials from the book and a bonus chapter, “A Brief Guide to Meetings”.

Upon the request of readers, we asked faculty to recommend books for an interaction design reading list. These could be landmark texts, underdogs, or critical reads, or stepping stones to other fields. The following is what resulted from our request, comprising in part: a sneak preview of what will be assigned in courses; what some consider to be cornerstone interaction design texts; and what some consider important connections to other fields.</description></item></channel></rss>
