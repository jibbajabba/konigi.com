This is Des Traynor's lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic. http://vimeo.com/81544164</description></item><item><title>99u Conference Notes: Quirky Studio Visit with Ben Kaufman</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/99u-conference-notes-quirky-studio-visit-ben-kaufman/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/99u-conference-notes-quirky-studio-visit-ben-kaufman/</guid><description>A group of 99u attendees had a visit with Ben Kaufman, the CEO/founder of product development company Quirky, who gave us a look into how his company uses crowd-sourcing to deliver products. Here are some of my notes from that visit. More 99u notes to follow.
Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case.</description></item><item><title>Your app is a collection of tiny details</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/your-app-collection-tiny-details/</guid><description>"Getting the details right is the difference between something that delights, and something customers tolerate."
&amp;#8212;Jeff Atwood
I didn't read Jeff Atwood's article about cat feeders right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It's also a terrific demonstration of what he's saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to satisfice with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it.</description></item><item><title>Letting Go</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/letting-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/letting-go/</guid><description>Two great slides from Yiibu's presentation, Letting Go, a talk about design in an time of increasing disruption.
"Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don't necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve."

Usually it's a pithy piece of advice about how to do the right thing, do right by your product, and thereby do right for the market by serving the right users with the product they want, and forgetting about trying to serve everyone else.
Here's one thought about really knowing your use case and putting it out front for the market to see, and letting it guide your conversation.</description></item><item><title>Being Without Chasing: The Grateful Dead vs. The Top 40</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/being-without-chasing-grateful-dead-vs-top-40/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/being-without-chasing-grateful-dead-vs-top-40/</guid><description>Seth Godin's blog entry, &amp;quot;The Grateful Dead and the Top 40,&amp;quot; looks at a band that only ever had 1 &amp;quot;hit record,&amp;quot; but who were very succesful at what they did. They may have not hit the Top 40 more than once, but one thing is true, they knew themselves as artists, and were true to that.
In terms of chart success, Elton John is probably the polar opposite of The Grateful Dead.</description></item><item><title>Steve Jobs on Saying No</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/steve-jobs-saying-no/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/steve-jobs-saying-no/</guid><description>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”

The experienced fly fisherman with only one rod, one type of fly, and one type of line will always outfish the duffer with an entire quiver of gear and flies.

Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid... "you have to work smarter not harder."
Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be.</description></item><item><title>Working through Screens Book</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/working-through-screens-book/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/working-through-screens-book/</guid><description>Flashbulb Interactions's Working through Screens is an excellent, well-illustrated ebook on concept design for designers and product developers.
