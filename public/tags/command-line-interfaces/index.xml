      <description>Ubiquity for Firefox from Aza Raskin on Vimeo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed by Aza Raskin&amp;rsquo;s Ubiquity add on for Firefox, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with a lot lately. It completely makes up for the less than exciting experience I had with Enso, which never came close to a Quicksilver experience on Windows. Ubiquity is pretty much the Quicksilver experience brought to your web browser. A smart tool that is summoned by a keyboard shortcut, and provides shortcuts to frequently used tools, and contextually relevant paths to using selected content in the page.</description>
