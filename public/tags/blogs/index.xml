      <description>UX A Day looks like a nice new blog of resources and tools for UX design folks, curated by Philippe Said. Not a lot of review or commentary, but hopefully will keep us updated with new finds.

      <title>fueledbycoffee iPad Sketch Blog</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling people how much I dig Adobe&amp;rsquo;s free Ideas app and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for sketching on the iPad. Craighton Berman&amp;rsquo;s Fueled by Coffee sketchblog will give you an idea of what sketches can look like using these tools. Ideas is super simple and smoothens your lines so things look naturally drawn.
I&#39;m really loving it. The adjustment is taking time, and it&#39;s not as quick as pen and paper, but it&#39;s slightly more natural using a Pogo Sketch Stylus.</description>

      <description>Wearecolorblind.com is a website about colorblindness created by Tom van Beveren. Van Beveren discusses good and bad examples of interfaces, charts and diagrams with respect to how they are viewed by color-blind users. He also provides patterns and suggestions for improving their accessibility. Would be excellent to pass some of the examples through some of the simulators I recommend.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/printed-blog/</guid>
      <description>The Printed Blog is an interesting project that aims at publishing a newspaper of weblogs and user generated content. I like the idea of using this as a PDF rather than as a printed newspaper, since I no longer read printed newspapers. I also like the newspaper format, and have been using Tabbloid to peruse my must read daily feeds rather than using my RSS reader lately. I wonder, however, about taking online media and making analog versions of it.</description>

      <description>The User Interface Design Group at MIT has started their Teatime Blog. Info about the blog from entry #1:
The sharing of knowledge and ideas is of fundamental importance to the advancement of technology. With this goal in mind, MIT’s User Interface Design group meets once a day at Tea Time to brainstorm new ideas, review new technologies and ideas, and share their experiences working in the field.
If we hope to herald innovation by sharing ideas with a research group , then there’s a boundless value to sharing ideas and thoughts with the world at large.</description>

      <description>This is a very topically focused blog I can appreciate. Kate Rutter of Adaptive Path started, StickyNote Ninja, a site dedicated to using sticky notes for more than just to do reminders.
From her about page, she says &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;I’ve been using them in my work, my personal life and as a tool to help companies work faster, more collaboratively, and to make smart decisions that stick. In 2007, I began speaking to groups about these simple, cheap, ubiquitous and powerful tools.</description>
