      <description>Where Google Search gave us syntax for doing all kinds of advanced searching, Google Calendar goes a more natural route. When Calendar was released, it introduced a lot of people to the idea of the natural language command line for the web via the &#34;Quick Add&#34; feature. Via a simple form input, you enter basic event info, e.g. &#34;Lunch with Judy on Thusday at 1pm.&#34; The event is quickly added, and you click the event title in the calendar to edit the details.</description>

      <description>Goosh, which dubs itself &#34;the unofficial google shell&#34; interprets the idea of presenting a command line interface via a web site literally. The site uses AJAX to present a terminal shell interface to Google. For simple searches, just enter keywords and click Enter. Type h for help with other commands. It even provides history functionality using keyboard up/down arrows.
1. The default screen is literally a command line interface.2. Help shows available commands.</description>

      <description>Presdo is a calendaring service that uses a simple form input as the command line for entering natural language commands for events. To use, enter event statements as with Google Calendar. It is always assumed that you are the subject&amp;#8212;the WHO. You just have to fill in the rest of the WHAT, WITH WHOM, and WHERE parts of the statement, e.g. &#34;Have lunch with Judy on Thursday at 1pm.&#34; Once you&#39;ve submitted the basic event info, you&#39;re presented with a more complete UI for entering event details, and this is where the service far surpasses Google&#39;s.</description>
