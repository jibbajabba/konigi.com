The Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction is the main project, where they've engaged professors and designers to contribute chapters that include HD video and commentary.
Mads and crew will soon release a chapter on Social Computing and its relation to social media, written by Tom Erickson, veteran researcher in social computing at IBM Watson Research Lab.</description></item></channel></rss>
