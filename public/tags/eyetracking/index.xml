      <description>Christina Laun summarizes the top lessons to take away from eyetracking studies.
 Text attracts attention before graphics. Initial eye movement focuses on the upper left corner of the page. Users initially look at the top left and upper portion of the page before moving down and to the right. Readers ignore banners. Fancy formatting and fonts are ignored. Show numbers as numerals. Type size influences viewing behavior. Users only look at a sub headline if it interests them.</description>
