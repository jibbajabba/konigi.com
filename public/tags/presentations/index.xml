      <description>The devil runs UX workshops for idle hands, and he comes up with bad features. This is Des Traynor&#39;s lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic.  http://vimeo.com/81544164</description>

      <title>Presentation Skills Considered Harmful</title>

      <description>I don&#39;t like public speaking. I love talking to people one to one and in very small groups. But public speaking and me don&#39;t mix, and if you&#39;ve ever seen me speak, you probably agree. In the handful of times that I have spoken publicly, I think only two were really worth coming to see and hear. I believe the only reason the worthwhile talks were not utter failures was because I had something to share that I think people wanted to hear, and could get something out of.</description>

      <description>I gave a talk at Asbury Agile 2012 and have published my presentation deck and speaking notes as a zine-like mini book in a new section of this site. My friends on Instagram have seen me teasing out this talk for a few months now, and I&#39;m happy to get the ideas out because this is something I&#39;ve been thinking about ever since I started this site. This is the perspective of someone who is starting over and taking the beginners path.</description>

      <description>Two great slides from Yiibu&#39;s presentation, Letting Go, a talk about design in an time of increasing disruption.
 &#34;Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don&#39;t necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve.&#34;

      <description>If you&#39;re curious about Keynote prototyping, Travis Isaacs&#39; describes how he works with the presentation software to produce click-through prototypes. As Travis notes, it&#39;s even useful to people who like to go between a low-fidelity wireframe created in another application to interactive demonstrations.

      <description>The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness.
Peldi pointed me to a video of Kathy Sierra&#39;s presentation at Business of Software 09, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It&#39;s about user benefits, and not features--about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.</description>

      <description>View more presentations from Nick Finck.   Nick Finck and Raina Van Cleave&#39;s presentation slides from the SXSWi talk are up. Here&#39;s a summary:
User experiences are your everyday experiences—anything from operating a car, to making a pot of coffee, to ordering a pair of shoes online. User experience is the result of your interactions with a product or service, specifically how it’s delivered and its related artifacts according to the design.</description>

      <title>All the Right Way to Wireframe Videos</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/all-right-way-wireframe-videos/</link>

      <description>I wanted to capture all of the slides and videos into one entry to compare each of the guys&#39; approaches. The right way? There isn&#39;t one right way. That&#39;s the point. The one thread that does carry through, however, is a general process of discovery/research, sketching/ideation, selection/refinement, visual design. Will Evans

      <description>This is fantastic presentation from Pentagram&#39;s Michael Bierut at The 99 Percent conference. Shows how a quiet, humble, and empathetic bedside manner can be such useful attributes in a designer.
Renowned graphic designer Michael Bierut claims that he&#39;s not creative. Instead, he likens his job to that of a doctor who tends to patients – &#34;the sicker, the better.&#34; Digging into the 86 notebooks he&#39;s kept over the course of his career, Bierut walks us through 5 projects – from original conception to final execution – extracting a handful of simple lessons (e.</description>

      <title>Jane Austin &amp; Chris Neale on Sketch Prototypes</title>

      <description>The paper prototype is generally used as a design tool and even usability testing tool, but the folks at IG Index have figured out a creative way to use sketches and paper prototypes as a communication tool in place of wireframes for demonstrating interaction to development teams. Martin Belam posted video from UX London 09 of Jane Austin, Chris Neale and Frances Eida discussing this simple method of taking wireframe/storyboard sketches or paper prototypes, and creating stop-motion animation to demonstrate interface.</description>

      <title>Redub Designs a Better Online Magazine</title>

      <description>I came across Redub&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Make Me Scroll&#34; presentation embedded above, which looks at the current offering of magazine readers which are modeled after print layouts, are difficult to read, SEO-unfriendly, and which rarely use the full capabilities provided by web browsers, e.g. multi-media. Or they&#39;re modeled largely after blogs with articles are long and scrolling, are limited by the possibilities of HTML/CSS, and have layouts that aren&#39;t differentiated from blogs and which pale in comparison to the layout in the printed version of the original magazine article.</description>
