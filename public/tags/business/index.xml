What was probably seen a few years ago as a radical way of structuring companies to organize around the work rather than using inflexible business units as boundaries, is now more commonplace.

Peldi pointed me to a video of Kathy Sierra's presentation at Business of Software 09, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It's about user benefits, and not features--about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.</description></item><item><title>Silverado Vineyards</title><link>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/silverado-vineyards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/designs/submissions/silverado-vineyards/</guid><description>Silverado Vineyards celebrates a new Flash website with an interactive vineyard map and gorgeous photo galleries on most wine, tours, and tasting pages to bring visitors to the heart of Sonoma County, online.

Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid... "you have to work smarter not harder."
Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be.</description></item><item><title>Start-Up Forms Library</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/start-forms-library/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/start-forms-library/</guid><description>Orrick Start-Up Tool Kit provides free legal forms that you will need to start and grow your company.

It's a funding platform for artists, designers, filmmakers, musicians, journalists, inventors, bloggers, etc. It works much like fundraising sites you may have used if you've ever had to raise money for events for non profit organizations. A few years ago I used a similar one for Team In Training.
You set up a page stating your mission and the need for funding.</description></item><item><title>Low-Cost Multi-point Interactive Whiteboards Using the Wiimote</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/low-cost-multi-point-interactive-whiteboards-using-wiimote/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/low-cost-multi-point-interactive-whiteboards-using-wiimote/</guid><description>Researcher provides another Wii Remote hack, this time to help business users create interactive whiteboards on the cheap.

You may want to impress your client with the vast amount of knowledge that you have, however, if they do not understand it, then all of your effort is lost. ... [W]hen explaining a concept, slow down, provide examples and talk in familiar terms.

This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you're a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project.</description></item></channel></rss>
