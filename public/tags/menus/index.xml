      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pinterest&#39;s mobile app displays a radial menu if you tap on an image. The menu items are for functions that are also available using the icons and buttons in the top of the UI for allowing you to pin, like, or send the image.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I like Brad Frost&#39;s examples for handling both complex navigation and simple navigation needs on responsive designs.

      <title>How to Make Tree Components in OmniGraffle</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/how-make-tree-components-omnigraffle/</link>

      <description>I swear I&#39;ve answered this question a dozen times, so I&#39;m capturing to refer people in the future. The tree control in my OmnGraffle Wireframe Stencil is a godawful hack that uses tabs and arrow characters. Copying and pasting the arrows, however, screws up the formatting. OmniGraffle just doesn&#39;t make this kind of manipulation of text all that easy and I haven&#39;t found an ideal solution, but if you want to learn how I do it, read on.</description>

      <description>Target&#39;s global navigation features wide, multi-column drop-down menus that stretch to the full width of the page layout. The columns in the drop down show hierarchical lists of product/section contents using font weight and indentation, and additionally allow the company to promote special events.
1. Drop down for the &amp;quot;Women&amp;quot; section shows a multi-column hierarchical list of all product sub-categories.2. The &amp;quot;See All&amp;quot; menu item allows the site to show other product categories that aren&#39;t being featured.</description>

      <description>Google modified the labeling (tagging) menus in Gmail to add a Move option to co-exist with the prior Label drop down menu. The Move menu allows the user to move an email to a single label and then archives it, removing it from the Inbox. The Label menu allows the user to add multiple labels to the email, but does not archive it. Both menus offer a label search input with auto-completion, as well as options to create new or manage existing labels.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/shelfari-hybrid-buttons/</guid>
      <description>Shelfari has a clever hybrid button/drop down menu to display actions on books. The button label shows the current status of the item, e.g. on my shelf, add to my shelf. When the user hovers over a button of a book that&#39;s not in your shelf, the label changes to &#34;Add to I&#39;ve Read&#34;. Clicking the drop down arrow shows other options for the book with shelf actions in the top half (I plan to read, I&#39;m reading now, I&#39;ve read), and the bottom half shows other attributes of your book (Favorite, I own, Wish list).</description>

      <description>Effective UI has an interesting Flash UI for presenting menus on their home page using a stacked accordion. Upon landing on the home page, a series of stacked boxes are displayed with both a large descriptive heading of that section and shows the first mini-slide in that deck/stack to help you see what that section is about. Mousing over the first slide in the stack expands the stack to show the headings for the other nodes of content within it, and the user may now hover over the other items to view their descriptions.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia Roll, a Flash-based Wikipedia browsing application attempts to help provide better exploration of Wikipedia entries by doing some content/link analysis and clustering topics and sub-topics related to the retrieved entry. The screen above shows the entry for &#34;interaction design.&#34; You can see that the links occurring in the article, and presumably, other related topics are grouped into clusters that can be further explored. Each cluster provides a wheel tool for spinning through the group&#39;s available terms.</description>

The database provides a hierarchical subject taxonomy to describe items, and presents that hierarchy in the breadcrumbs for the item. When the user hovers ofer a branch in the breadcrumb trail, a drop down menu is displayed to show the node siblings and drill down to children. 1. Single entry view (database record).2. Hovering over the current entry&#39;s parent category (Daggers) to view siblings.</description>

      <description>Daylife&#39;s drop down menu in global navigation that provides a wide ribbon to show both navigation to secondary levels and to show teaser content, e.g. the Latest News menu shows top level news categories as well as recent articles in each category. News sites like Daylife and NewsVine have been coming up with interesting ways of changing user&#39;s expectations of what can exist in global navigation. In some cases, the labels and categories for what appear in global navigation suggest a shifting information architecture that is based on what&#39;s interesting now or what people have been reading.</description>

      <title>Google Analytics Drop Down Menus</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/google-analytics-drop-down-menus/</guid>
      <description>I&#39;m a fan of the drop down menus that span a wide area, e.g. the main body or full page, in order to show a wider range of options rather showing fewer in a vertical drop down and forcing navigation through a fly-out tree. This convention is showing up mostly in global navigation, and with the introduction of Microsoft&#39;s Ribbon, we can expect to see more of it.
Google shows buttons with down arrows to indicate that clicking one of those controls will show expanded options in-screen, a la the drop down menu.</description>

      <title>Yahoo! Breadcrumb Tab</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/interfaces/yahoo-breadcrumb-tab/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/interfaces/yahoo-breadcrumb-tab/</guid>
      <description>Yahoo&#39;s hybrid tab/breadcrumb navigation is one of my favorite approaches to global and local navigation. This navigation interface answers a few nagging questions that an interface designer might ask. &#34;How do I present the user with an interface that provides focus on the area they&#39;ve navigated to, while providing a path back or to other main areas of interest?&#34;
What&#39;s interesting here is that they provide a row of primary navigation tabs at the top level, and replace that with a hybrid tab/breadcrumb once the user makes the decision to drill down.</description>

      <description>Testing of proof of concept prototypes of radial menus. The idea is to get users to try to select the same menu item repeatedly as the radial menu changes from state to state and capture participants feedback on usability of the interface.
