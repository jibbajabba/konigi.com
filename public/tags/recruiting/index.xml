The recruiter's site is a nicely implemented minimalist site that presents information with little fanfare. Navigation is very shallow, making content easy to traverse. One thing I think would work to this site's benefit is to move the job listings up in the hierarchy of pages and offer email notifications or RSS feeds of new jobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
