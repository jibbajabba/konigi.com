      <description>Represent Recruitment is a boutique career placement agency in London, UK serving professionals in creative design industries. The recruiter&amp;rsquo;s site is a nicely implemented minimalist site that presents information with little fanfare. Navigation is very shallow, making content easy to traverse. One thing I think would work to this site&amp;rsquo;s benefit is to move the job listings up in the hierarchy of pages and offer email notifications or RSS feeds of new jobs.</description>
