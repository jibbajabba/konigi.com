The site presently sports a single page-type design, with information for the beta. As users step through the demo slides or sign up for the beta, the marquee swaps information out while the rest of the layout and design stays in tact.</description></item><item><title>Twingr Registration: My mind was made up before I even tried the product</title><link>https://konigi.com/blog/twingr-registration-my-mind-was-made-i-even-tried-product/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/blog/twingr-registration-my-mind-was-made-i-even-tried-product/</guid><description>I very rarely will say anything about a site if the only opinion I have is negative.
