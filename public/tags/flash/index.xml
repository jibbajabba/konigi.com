Or they're modeled largely after blogs with articles are long and scrolling, are limited by the possibilities of HTML/CSS, and have layouts that aren't differentiated from blogs and which pale in comparison to the layout in the printed version of the original magazine article.</description></item><item><title>Sick City Club</title><link>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/sick-city-club/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/designs/submissions/sick-city-club/</guid><description>Sick City Club are a new band hotly tipped for 2009 by UK's Radio One. The new site was designed and built by Zaum &amp;amp; Brown. It's a full flash build powered by an xml cms. The design was inspired by traveling around a city, always being on the go.

Every drink name is an active message about excelling in sports and the video loop that runs in the background of product and athlete pages suffuses the site with the imagery of athletes kicking ass. A product filter allows users to view by product name or nutritient.
