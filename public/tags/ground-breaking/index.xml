      <description>The redesigned IDEO site has been sitting in a browser tab for a few weeks now because it just felt like one of those things I needed to mull over before writing about. It&#39;s one of the few sites this year that just took me by surprise. In short, the deep treasure trove of content unleashed in this redesign is a huge departure from the tightly constrained and minimalist prior design.</description>

      <description>Yugo Nakamura and the Simone Inc. crew are serving up some sick Flash once again for Uniqlo. This time, the mini site is devoted to women&#39;s bras. The mood is cheerful as happy electronic strings accompany the dizzying array of women&#39;s headshots spinning and combining to create patterns in 3D space. Click on a picture to reveal the details (in Japanese) of one of the women&#39;s age, height, and bra size, or use the pop up menus to filter the set down.</description>
