      <title>What If DJ Controllers Had Built In Screens?</title>

      <description>This is a cool design challenge that showed up on DJ Tech Tools&amp;rsquo; blog to mock up DJ controllers. DJ gear vendor Numark is reported to be releasing a controller with a screen. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting, because it could potentially let digital DJs that use them close their computer screen and focus on performing.
While there are CDJs that already have color LCDs to preview deck track information, midi controllers are largely comprised of faders, buttons, knobs, toggle switches, jog wheels, and touch sensitive strips.</description>

      <title>New Multi-touch Interactions on the Apple iPad</title>

      <description>Craig Villamor and Luke Wroblewski summarize the new interactions we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing in the iPad.
During Apple&#39;s 90 minute unveiling of the iPad this week, a lot of new multi-touch interactions were shown off. But they went by fast. So as a service to digital product designers everywhere, we took the time to extract 8 minutes of new user interface demos from the iPad keynote. Now you can quickly just catch the UI in action on Apple&#39;s new native iPad and iWork applications.</description>

      <description>Bill Buxton&#39;s &#34;Multi-Touch System I have Known and Loved&#34; has been updated as of Sept. 2009. The article provides examples and a history of the multi touch systems Buxton has been involved with or known about over the years. Multi-touch technologies have a long history. To put it in perspective, my group at the University of Toronto was working on multi-touchin 1984 (Lee, Buxton &amp;amp; Smith, 1985), the same year that the first Macintosh computer was released, and we were not the first.</description>

      <description>This is video showing the interaction design of a Surface interface to configure the Audi A4.
Audi A4 Car Configurator by Neue Digitale / Razorfish in collaboration with Realtime Technology AG. Showcased at this year’s IAA - the world’s leading automotive fair. The application allows multiple users to configure an Audi A4 simultaneously by changing the car&amp;rsquo;s paint finishes, rims and by selecting and coloring style package components. The configured A4 is experienced in an immersive 3d environment, in which users can navigate seamlessly by zooming and panning using a multitouch-enabled interface</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m becoming more and more intrigued by the latest offering of inexpensive touch screen PCs like the MSI Wind Top that have been released recently, as well as the rumored Apple Tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the penetration of touch interfaces on higher resolution desktop applications, which will start to spread at a much greater rate to a wider audience when we see low cost devices like tablets and touch screen desktops at netbook prices.</description>

      <description>Larva Labs&amp;rsquo; Intelligent Home Screen is a home screen replacement for Google Android devices that provides an information stream or feed. It divides the stream into 2 panels: private information on top (messages, calendar events) and public information on bottom (stock quotes, news). It provides color-coded category markers, and a draggable menubar that allows the user to selectively change the volume of information between top and bottom lists, and when pushed to a single end, provides focus on that category.</description>

      <description>Holger Struppek has written an article describing the design and prototyping process for the redesign of the Wells Fargo ATM user interface by Pentagram. This is a rare, in-depth look at the prototyping process for an interface that we come into contact regularly.
The agency was contracted to abandon the prior touch screen/solid state UI, and transform the software to work with touch screen interfaces only and improve flow and visual design.</description>

      <description>NYC IxDA - Tap is the New Click - Dan Saffer from Interaction Design Association on Vimeo. Dan Saffer gave a fantastic NYC IXDA presentation, Tap Is the New Click, discussing the rise of touch interfaces, their place and adoption in society, and the role of the interaction designer in designing these direct manipulation interfaces. Every IA and IXD needs to watch this. A summary of the talk below:
Even though the technology has been around for decades, only now are we starting to see mass production and adoption of touchscreen and gestural devices for the public.</description>

      <title>JazzMutant multi-touch controllers</title>

      <description>JazzMutant creates the Lemur and Dexter, multi-touch hardware controllers for audio production, live music and media performance. What I like about this is that it shows how much closer multi-touch brings devices to the experience of using analogous hardware controls like knobs, buttons, and sliders without any physical limitations. I once blog bitched about the fact that the Traktor DJ software I played for a few years limited the fun, and the ability to mix with two hands because at the time you could only use one input device, the mouse, to control the mixer.</description>

      <title>Pacemaker Mobile MP3 DJ Device Gets a GUI Redesign</title>

      <description>Pacemaker, the mobile MP3 DJ device that debuted last year with a 120 GB hard drive, is getting a 2.0 release this spring and offering an additional lower capacity 60 GB hard drive option, and a new user interface. I was enamored with this device and the way they could incorporate most of the possible mixer and track selection controls for 2 deck track mixing into a single, albeit large, handheld device with their original product UI.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve caught Chuck Todd using a desktop touch interface a few times on MSNBC to click through poll charts. While John King has been using a Perceptive Pixel-designed touch wall, Todd has been using a Microsoft Surface interface on a desktop. The device and manipulation of data on the screen looks very natural on this show, especially for the kind of information he&amp;rsquo;s speaking to. I think whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of visual information to add to a story, this kind of an interface has potential to be very helpful and I look forward to seeing what they do at MSNBC and on other shows.</description>

      <description>CNet reports on Swype, a new keyboard technology for touch screens created by the inventory of the T9 keyboard technology for numeric keypads. Swype lets the user drag their finger across the screen, touching each of the letters in the words they want to enter, and predictive software selects the word they wanted. This could be a great tool to the improve the typing experience on the iPhone, which I find pretty awful compared to a hardware keyboard.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/samsung-touchwiz-f480-phone-scoop/</guid>
      <description>PhoneScoop provides a demonstration and photos of the new Samsung TouchWiz finger touch user interface, a 2.0 version of the company&amp;rsquo;s Croix OS. This one of the first phones to rush to market in order to compete with the iPhone. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be a multi-touch-type interface for two-finger interactions like zooming, but dragging and dropping appears very similar to the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s drag behavior. One of the fun features is a very configurable home page, which provides user-selectable widgets.</description>

      <description>CNET reports on Johnny Chung Lee&amp;rsquo;s interaction experiments with the Wii Remote. Lee, a Phd student at Carnegie Melon, does a quick demo of head tracking for VR displays and multi point interaction using the wii remote. His experiments describe with incredible clarity how the wii remote fundamentally works and how the remote might be exploited to do much more than point at single points on the screen and control them.</description>
