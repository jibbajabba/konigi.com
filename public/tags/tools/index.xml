      <description>This is a guide for binding your own sketchbooks. I offer it to you designers, developers, makers, and tinkerers out there who are looking for a way to physically connect to your practice of designing interfaces, or who maybe just want a fun and practical way to get your hands dirty.
I started making my own sketchbooks and pads a few years ago. At the time there weren&amp;rsquo;t many options for interface sketching and storyboarding.</description>

      <description>Don&#39;t let anyone tell you that the tools you choose are wrong or inappropriate. Find the right design and keep winning.
Occasionally I&#39;m asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I&#39;m familiar with.</description>

      <description>[Update: This review was updated after getting the latest version of the Stylus Socks.]
My search for the perfect stylus for sketching on the iPad is over. I&#39;ve tried ever stylus I could get my hands on. The three finalists that earned a space on my desk or pocket in the past year have been the iClooly, the Stylus Socks, and the Griffin Stylus for iPad.

      <description>NOTE: Protokit is no longer being developed, but is still available for you to poke fun at.
Protokit was an experimental project to develop a toolkit for creating HTML prototypes. It uses the following open source libraries and plugins: Blueprint, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Templates, and iXEdit. More information about the included libraries and their licensing agreements can be found in theREADME file.
Version 0.1 was the preliminary version and is very rough.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s OmniGraffle, not Original Gangster. It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since the last update to my OmniGraffle Wireframe Stencils. I&amp;rsquo;m due for a new version after some cleanup and organization into separate stencils to make use of OG5&amp;rsquo;s nice new stencil panel. The above is the current state of my working stencil in all its ugly glory. Also in my stencil directory are a bunch of pre-fabricated stencils for the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in the past 2 years at Sling and at Traction.</description>

      <title>Silverback: Usability Testing Software for the Mac</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/silverback-usability-testing-software-mac/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/silverback-usability-testing-software-mac/</guid>
      <description>Silverback launches to provide UX pros with Macintoshes a simple, inexpensive tool for recording usability test sessions, so you won&amp;rsquo;t have to ever touch another Windows box if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to. (I&amp;rsquo;m kidding. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will at some point in your life.)
Silverback provides most of the functionality you need for discount usability. People wanting a full featured tool like Morae won&amp;rsquo;t find their solution here, but if all you want is to organize test sessions, capture audio/video of screen interactions and participants face and voice, then Silverback might be for you.</description>

      <title>Continuum Javascript Ratio Calculator</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/continuum-javascript-ratio-calculator/</guid>
      <description>Continuum&amp;rsquo;s Javascript Ratio Calculator is a handy tool you can use to calculate object dimensions based on a ratio you provide. You can do this easily in a graphics tool like Photoshop by setting an image size and resizing, but this can be useful when you just need to pull those dimensions out when planning a project layout.

      <guid>http://konigi.com/tools/graph-paper/</guid>
      <description>About This 8.5 x 11 inch graph paper is made for visual designers, interaction designers, and information architects. You&#39;ll find styles for wireframing user interfaces, and story boarding interaction. I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s also used by animators and filmmakers. Enjoy.
 Scanning These cyan and gray grid pages are great for sketching, but also work well when producing high fidelity drawings. The boxes and grid lines of the cyan versions are non-photo blue, so you can easily remove them when scanned.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/6-screenshot-utilities-you-should-know-about/</guid>
      <description>I use different screen capture utilities depending on the type of screen I&amp;rsquo;m trying to grab. Some are great for a quick and dirty capture of a page I want to send someone. Others are good for annotating an interface I want to post to a web page. And still others are best for archival screen capture or for interfaces with video. Below are the 6 screenshot utilities that Mac users should know about.</description>
