      <description>This is a guide for binding your own sketchbooks. I offer it to you designers, developers, makers, and tinkerers out there who are looking for a way to physically connect to your practice of designing interfaces, or who maybe just want a fun and practical way to get your hands dirty.
I started making my own sketchbooks and pads a few years ago. At the time there weren&#39;t many options for interface sketching and storyboarding.</description>

      <description>About This DIY magnet template is based on the Konigi wireframe stencils and includes 3 sheets of elements that might be useful in whiteboard prototyping. Simply download and print the PDFs onto magnet sheets, optionally laminate them if you intend to use with dry-erase markers, and finally cut them out.
 Printing These sheets are made to print on magnetic sheets, and were designed and tested for use with Avery 3270 Printable Magnet Sheets for Inkjet Printers.</description>

      <title>Graph Paper</title>

      <description>About This 8.5 x 11 inch graph paper is made for visual designers, interaction designers, and information architects. You&#39;ll find styles for wireframing user interfaces, and story boarding interaction. I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s also used by animators and filmmakers. Enjoy.
 Scanning These cyan and gray grid pages are great for sketching, but also work well when producing high fidelity drawings. The boxes and grid lines of the cyan versions are non-photo blue, so you can easily remove them when scanned.</description>
