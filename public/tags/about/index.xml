      <description>This is perhaps more about information architecture than interface or interaction design. One thing I like about Digg&#39;s About section is the transparency of the company that&#39;s suggested here. They only provide email addresses for contacting the company, rather than providing a form. They provide 4 types of contact: feedback, abuse, press, and partners, each type of gets sent to an email address. This exposes you, the sender, as it doesn&#39;t allow the sending of anonymous email, and gives them a way to respond to you.</description>
