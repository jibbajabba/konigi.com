      <description>Josh Spector’s article, “Only Do It If You’re Willing To Do It 100 Times,” explains why committing to doing something 100 times furthers your efforts towards accomplishing a goal. He writes that the 100x method gives you a way to use a seemingly arbitrary structure to discipline you through the challenge of working towards a goal that may seem large at the onset. That structure also serves to push you forward through what Seth Godin refers to in&amp;nbsp;The Dip&amp;nbsp;— that point in the project where you’re unsure whether to go on or quit.</description>

      <description>I keep Sister Corita Kent’s 10 Art Department Rules on my personal workspace wall. It’s also the wallpaper I have on my Mac Desktop.
If you need the reminder to “do the work,” whatever that means to you, you can download one of the wallpapers below:</description>

      <description>I was chatting with UX friends Matt and Mark when the topic of taste came up. Mark brought up the Ira Glass Storytelling series of videos, which are great. If you haven&#39;t seen it, there&#39;s a great discussion on taste for creators. This is Ira Glass from This American Life talking about story telling, and how we get into creative work because we love it and we have good taste. He talks about the gap in the beginning when we&#39;re trying to make stuff, that turns out short of our expectations.</description>
