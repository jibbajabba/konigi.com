The faint radial gradient for the lighting effect on the centered logo is perfect, perhaps making reference to the light from a church apse shining down on an alter, which of course has symbolic meaning. It's a very subtle thing, and I'm not sure it's intended, but it has a powerful effect and adds a subtext to the design.</description></item></channel></rss>
