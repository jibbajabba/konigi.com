      <description>I&#39;m certainly no stranger to being opinionated and argumentative. I&#39;ve put my foot in my mouth a few times by pushing back on others&#39; ideas, and am well aware that being quick to react can be detrimental. The older I get, the more I realize how little I know and how much more time I need to spend thinking after listening, before I open my mouth or start to type to respond.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin&#39;s blog often talks about where successful ideas come from, and in this post talks about bypassing the need to make huge leaps in innovation by synthesizing what we know and have learned from history, using Palm as the cautionary tale.
It&#39;s not enough to be aware of the domain you&#39;re working in, you need to understand it. Noticing things and being curious about how they work is the single most common trait I see in creative people.</description>

      <description>Jared Spool talks about why designers who code are popular in Silicon Valley right now, and for the most part, it boils down to this. Small software and web startups value and are able to use a broader range of skillsets, because one of the highest priorities, especially for bootstrapped startups, is to ship while lean on resources.

      <description>Fred Beecher wrote what he thinks are the nine essential characteristics you must possess to make a good software user experience designer, in reaction to a comment made about skills an IA should possess. It&#39;s an excellent read for those listing qualifications and evaluating UX Designers for hire, and a great list of qualities for job-seekers to demonstrate during interviews.
 A Deep Understanding of Human Psychology &amp;amp; Research Methods Competence in the Basics of Graphic Design An Awareness of and Interest in Technology Verbal &amp;amp; Visual Communication Skills Moderate Familiarity with Business, Deep Familiarity with Your Business The Ability to Quickly Learn a Subject Matter Area Mediation, Facilitation, &amp;amp; Translation Skills Creativity &amp;amp; Vision Passion  Elizabeth Buie also added a familiarity with HCI literature, and undboubtedly with HCI history, which I think should be there as well.</description>
