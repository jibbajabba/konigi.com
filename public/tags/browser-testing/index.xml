Just enter a URL, hit Enter, and the new URL gets automatically loaded on each device. Works on platforms like Android, Blackberry, iOS, Maemo, Meego, Symbian, Windows Phone and WebOS. I don't think the GameBoy pictured is supported. ;)
Source code is available on Github.</description></item><item><title>Responsive Design Bookmarklet</title><link>http://konigi.com/links/responsive-design-bookmarklet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/links/responsive-design-bookmarklet/</guid><description>Victor Coulon's Responsive Design Bookmarklet is a simple browser-based tool for testing your web layout in desktop, tablet and mobile phone dimensions.
