      <title>Hello Hugo: Konigi is now a Static Site</title>

      <description>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I did it.
Choosing Static Site Generators In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</description>

      <description>uilang is a minimal, ui-focused programming language for web designers that handles click events, primarily for toggling classes and css display properties. I love the natural language approach to scripting in uilang. You just insert a statement in a code block like this and it works magically: &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;clicking on &#34;.try-it&#34; toggles class &#34;hidden&#34; on &#34;.info-box&#34;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; You still have to write your CSS to handle things like effects, but that&#39;s a plus if you don&#39;t want or need someone else&#39;s implementation of those things.</description>

      <description>Adobe Labs&#39; Shadow is an application for Mac and Windows that allows you to preview and inspect your mobile website on iOS and Android devices.
After installing the software on your computer and any number of mobile devices, you can connect and pair them and all devices will be kept in sync with the web site you&#39;re previewing on your computer. This should help perform remote inspection and debugging so you can see HTML/CSS/JavaScript changes instantly on your devices.</description>

      <title>Why The Valley Wants Designers That Can Code</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/why-valley-wants-designers-can-code/</link>

      <description>Jared Spool talks about why designers who code are popular in Silicon Valley right now, and for the most part, it boils down to this. Small software and web startups value and are able to use a broader range of skillsets, because one of the highest priorities, especially for bootstrapped startups, is to ship while lean on resources.
Jared notes that those who don&#39;t think designers should know how to code say this dilutes the designer&#39;s value.</description>

      <title>Napkin Look &amp; Feel</title>

      <description>Napkin Look and Feel is a cool looking open source tool for Java developers to produce application prototypes with a low-fidelity sketchy interface.
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully functional for development. Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code behind it is working.</description>

      <description>SproutCore has been getting some buzz after the June Apple WWDC, where SproutCore was demoed. This is an MVC framework that builds a standards-based application that runs entirely in the browser and is not tied to a single scripting language to power the back end. The framework is being used to drive the new MobileMe service from Apple.
SproutCore is a framework for building applications in JavaScript with remarkably little amounts of code.</description>

      <description>Designers come up with great ideas, but we aren&#39;t always the right people to pull off the technical implementation. If you&#39;re like me, you might be itching to get some of those ideas out into the world. oDesk is a resource for finding and tracking freelance developers to work on your project. If you want to get your sketches into the hands of someone who will make it real, this might be a useful resource.</description>
