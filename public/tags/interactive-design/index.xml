      <description>The Secret Location is an agency that works on interactive, film, animation, and motion graphics. Their portfolio exemplifies their work, by providing an immersive flash experience around a conjured up story leading a character to follow a mysterious path that leads to the secret location. Luckily the story is short and engaging, because that location leads down the path to the real goods, the company site and portfolio. Once you summon the remote control in the lower left menu, you navigate with a pretty simple hierarchical tree to drill down into the portfolio.</description>
