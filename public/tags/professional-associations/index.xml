      <description>I&#39;ve finally gotten around to checking out the Interaction Design Association (IXDA) site relaunch, which has been redesigned and migrated to the Drupal platform. The IXDA has one of the most impressive list archives for professional association that I&#39;ve ever used, and the new features provided by this platform open up a host of new notification options. There are a few more browsing options in the discussion area, a resource library, and what looks like a redesigned job board.</description>
