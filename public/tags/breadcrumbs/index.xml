Breadcrumb Tab</title><link>https://konigi.com/interfaces/yahoo-breadcrumb-tab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/interfaces/yahoo-breadcrumb-tab/</guid><description>Yahoo's hybrid tab/breadcrumb navigation is one of my favorite approaches to global and local navigation. This navigation interface answers a few nagging questions that an interface designer might ask. "How do I present the user with an interface that provides focus on the area they've navigated to, while providing a path back or to other main areas of interest?"
What's interesting here is that they provide a row of primary navigation tabs at the top level, and replace that with a hybrid tab/breadcrumb once the user makes the decision to drill down.</description></item></channel></rss>
