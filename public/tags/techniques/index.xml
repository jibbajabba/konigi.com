The right way? There isn't one right way. That's the point. The one thread that does carry through, however, is a general process of discovery/research, sketching/ideation, selection/refinement, visual design. Will Evans

Lorem Ipsum, wireframes, personas, etc are just tactics. The only thing that matters is: Do people love what you built?
Amen, brother. Here's 1 cent... I agree with Karen about Lorem Ipsum.

There's an abundance of examples with screenshots and deconstruction of interfaces to demonstrate the techniques in practice.

It's certainly common to see designer's tack up pieces of paper around their project space, e.g. schematics, pictures with references to other objects that provide inspiration, etc. Hunkering, however, is more of a technique to create disorientation and change in one's perspective momentarily, to assess what you've done. Visual disorientation is a fast way to identify the places where things don't quite match up.</description></item><item><title>UX Vision: The design superpower also known as The Squint Test</title><link>http://konigi.com/blog/ux-vision-design-superpower-also-known-squint-test/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://konigi.com/blog/ux-vision-design-superpower-also-known-squint-test/</guid><description>UX Hero points out a technique that you may not be using, but should consider. Stepping back and squinting to evaluate your work is something I was told to do repeatedly when I was first learning to paint, and is something I still do today as an interface designer. It helps you see the whole of your screen and look for anything that stands out, and see what needs to draw more attention, depending on the priority and hierarchy of your page elements.</description></item></channel></rss>
