      <description>Mike Lohrman&#39;s Wireframe Showcase is a user-contributed wireframe and UI sketch gallery. I&#39;m hoping, since there is some space on the individual pages for content, that we&#39;ll see a little more discussion about process and design thinking here rather than mere visuals of design artifacts. It&#39;s always good to see more people showing how they explore ideas with sketches and wireframes.

      <title>Beautiful Minimal Websites</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/beautiful-minimal-websites/</link>

      <description>I&#39;m enjoying the 6 part collection of minimalist designs posted by Vandelay Design. Some sites are more minimalist than others. I tend to use that term loosely at times as well. But the predominant theme seems to be type as interface, minimal use of graphics (aside from a logo and the body content), few if any graphic treatments of navigation, and little to no use of texture and graphic effects, and liberal use of white space.</description>

      <description>Google&#39;s Chrome Experiments lab showcases some interesting uses of Javascript. We think JavaScript is awesome. We also think browsers are awesome. Indeed, when we talk about them, we say they are the cat&#39;s meow â€“ which is an American expression meaning AWESOME.
In light of these deeply held beliefs, we created this site to showcase cool experiments for both JavaScript and web browsers.
These experiments were created by designers and programmers from around the world.</description>
