      <description>I&#39;m off to work in Italy for a week with the Balsamiq team, so no posting on Konigi while I&#39;m gone. For the travelers who care about packing on the light side, here&#39;s how I&#39;m going to roll on a single carryon bag.
- Goruck GR2 backpack (first trip with this bag)
- Gear
-- Mac short power cord
-- Euro travel adapter plug
-- Mini USB cords (I have a different set, but Griffin&#39;s looks cool)</description>
