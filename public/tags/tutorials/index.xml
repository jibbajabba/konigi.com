      <description>CSS-Tricks wrote up a tutorial demonstrating how to use CSS clipping to use image sprite on inline elements that flow with content. This is a nice little technique for small icons that you want to come immediately after text, for example. Check it out.

      <description>I&#39;ve been wanting for the past year or so to do sketch style wireframes in OmniGraffle.

      <title>Mac Tip: Mounting a Server Automatically</title>

      <description>One of the things I&#39;ve always found a chore, being a producer of graphic documents, is versioning and organizing the docs for a team. I&#39;ve had to use different tools like Source Safe, Sharepoint, Basecamp, and just shared drives to this. One nice thing I like about working with our Traction server is that it does Webdav for document management and file versioning. That&#39;s one of the projects I&#39;m working on a preview release of to make the web-based interface a bit more friendly.</description>

      <title>3 JQuery Methods for Interactive Menu Effects</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/3-jquery-methods-interactive-menu-effects/</link>

      <description>3 recent articles show how to get interactive effects on menus, proving that you don&#39;t need Flash for this kind of simple interactivity.  Dave Shea&#39;s tutorial in ALA shows how to create interactive menu hover effects using CSS sprites and the JQuery Javascript library. A sprite image is a single graphic with multiple states mapped on the graphic, a technique borrowed from game design, where game characters are shown in different states of action.</description>

      <description>You remember Webmonkey, that web design resource many of us grew up with when we were cutting our teeth on HTML. Wired redesigned and re-launched with a few new articles, and some of the old tutes and cheat sheets seem to have been updated. The entire code library appears to be a wiki, so it&#39;s open for editing. We&#39;ll keep our eyes open to see if anyone kicks in some quality material.</description>
