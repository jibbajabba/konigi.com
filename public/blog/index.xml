      <description>Camper graphic by Vecteezy!
I grew up in central New Jersey. My family lived a modest middle class lifestyle and I’d never flown on a plane with my nuclear family growing up. What we did was camp. We went car camping every summer. I have fond memories up through 8th grade of those summers.
When I was in the 5th grade and about 10 years old, we went on a month long car camping trip from New Jersey to California through the middle states (Illinois, North Dakota, Colorado), and then back through the southern states (Arizona, Texas, Louisiana).</description>

      <title>The Power of 100</title>

      <description>Josh Spector’s article, “Only Do It If You’re Willing To Do It 100 Times,” explains why committing to doing something 100 times furthers your efforts towards accomplishing a goal. He writes that the 100x method gives you a way to use a seemingly arbitrary structure to discipline you through the challenge of working towards a goal that may seem large at the onset. That structure also serves to push you forward through what Seth Godin refers to in&amp;nbsp;The Dip&amp;nbsp;— that point in the project where you’re unsure whether to go on or quit.</description>

      <description>This is a little zine I made from my Sketch talk.
I&amp;rsquo;m putting these in the package when people buy a sketchbook. I&amp;rsquo;ll be sending one out soon to everyone who already purchased a book. Still working on setting up international shipping. :)

A little zine has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to make. This is a zine in the traditional, DIY photocopy sense. It&amp;rsquo;s not an art piece, as so many beautiful zines are these days.</description>

      <description>I published a free course for Balsamiq users on Skillshare. The course, Rapid Wireframing: Finding the Right Product Design, is designed for those new to Balsamiq, but also features some demonstration of new features like Quick Draw (using the mouse to block out wireframe zones) and Alternates (creating alternate versions of screens). If you&amp;rsquo;re a veteran user, you may be interested in checking that out, and updating to the latest version to take advantage of these useful new ways of working on projects.</description>

      <title>5.25 Inch Floppy Sketchbook Is Back</title>

      <description>Remember these? From 2009-2010 I these sketchbooks for a while, using a 5.25&amp;rdquo; floppy disk as a notebook cover. I kind of missed them, so I made a limited number in blank and grid paper.
It’s a wirebound 5.25 inch square sketchbook with about 120-130 pages (60-65 sheets) of 70 pound white vellum paper, hand-crafted by me in my home North of the SF Bay. You can buy a book with blank sheets or one printed with 1cm grid in warm gray ink.</description>

      <description>For Balsamiq users or anyone that bemoans handwritten fonts and sketchy wireframes, I wrote an article to show how to create polished wireframes in Balsamiq on our UX blog. It shows how to use the wireframe skin with a few base controls, and techniques to achieve a minimalist aesthetic. It&amp;rsquo;s meant for those who need to create client-ready deliverables, or for when the sketchy-skin gets in the way of communicating your ideas.</description>

      <title>Jim Kalbach on Jazz as a Model for the Way Businesses Work</title>
      <link>http://konigi.com/blog/jim-kalbach-jazz/</link>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/jim-kalbach-jazz/</guid>
      <description>Jim Kalbach talks about the improvisational model of Jazz as a metaphor for the way some businesses approach collaboration today. What was probably seen a few years ago as a radical way of structuring companies to organize around the work rather than using inflexible business units as boundaries, is now more commonplace.
To demonstrate what happens in the teamwork of a group of jazz performers, Kalbach assembled a group of musicians to perform a song they hadn&amp;rsquo;t played together before, and described how jazz performances &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; as a type of collaboration.</description>

      <description>After many years of being a Drupal user, from version 2 when I started iaslash.org to version 6 on this site, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the move from PHP/MySQL blog to full on static site. Here&amp;rsquo;s why and how I did it.
Choosing Static Site Generators In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a few sites backwards from Drupal and WordPress into the age of static sites. In many ways, it feels like going back to the beginning of my career, when I used Perl and Shell scripts to generate sites in my first job, and later to more sophisticated site generation using MovableType as a middle man.</description>

      <description>Code.org now has an elementary school program (Kindergarden - 5th grade), and Code Studio for the program looks like its modeled after the free MIT Scratch app, a visual tool that we used with our first son to introduce computer science fundamentals a few years ago.

      <description>Aral Balkan’s “I, Simulation” talk about the current state of privacy and freedom in software and services is one the best presentations I’ve watched this year. Balkan talks about business models that focus on user data, and what that can mean to your &#34;privacy.&#34; Watch the talk below, given at Open Exchange in Munich, Germany.  The information you hand over using service providers like Facebook (think also Messenger, Whatsapp, Instagram) and Google (think also Gmail, Hangouts, Android Devices, Drive, Nest, Dropcam, and Fiber) is already being used to create simulations of you, and he likens this use to spyware.</description>

      <description>The devil runs UX workshops for idle hands, and he comes up with bad features. This is Des Traynor&amp;rsquo;s lightning talk at Business of Software in 2013. He did an extended version of this in 2014, but the pecha kucha version gets to the heart of the topic.

      <description>I got an IPEVO Interactive Whiteboard System ($149 retail price) to demo and did a first little experiment. The product consists of a video sensor and interactive pen. You have to have a projector as well. Here&#39;s a super rough demo I made for my team at Balsamiq to show how it would work using Balsamiq Mockups.
 While the demo is pretty rough given the 15 minutes I gave myself to set up and record with my phone, it&#39;s pretty interesting to consider the possibilities for whiteboarding with wireframing software, if you&#39;re so inclined.</description>

      <title>What If DJ Controllers Had Built In Screens?</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/what-if-dj-controllers-had-built-screens/</guid>
      <description>This is a cool design challenge that showed up on DJ Tech Tools&amp;rsquo; blog to mock up DJ controllers. DJ gear vendor Numark is reported to be releasing a controller with a screen. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting, because it could potentially let digital DJs that use them close their computer screen and focus on performing.
While there are CDJs that already have color LCDs to preview deck track information, midi controllers are largely comprised of faders, buttons, knobs, toggle switches, jog wheels, and touch sensitive strips.</description>

      <description>Frank Rapacciuolo is writing a series of Interviews of User Interface &amp;amp; User Experience Designers in a collection at Medium. In the interviews he asks people about their background, what they tell people they do, what a typical work day looks like, and gets opinions on several UX topics including the impact of design on society and where they stand on jumping directly into visual design.

Kaufman got his start as an inventor in high school when he made a lanyard to hold an iPod shuffle. The company he started to ship this product later morphed into Mophie, the maker of the JuiceBox battery case.</description>

      <description>I love Berg&amp;rsquo;s demo of their Cloudwash smart washing machine concept. The company created the prototype to demonstrate how a smart networked appliance might be better designed. The video provides an excellent walkthrough of their design process.
They simplify the face, which consisted of many controls for dedicated functions, reducing that to &amp;ldquo;high value functions&amp;rdquo; only. More functionality is accessible via a smart phone app, which also integrates the device with services such as warranty and supplies management and purchasing.</description>

      <description>We know that starting with why is important to product design, but what comes next? &#34;How&#34; would definitely come soon after. But there are many ways to propose how to begin exploring possibilities. The 99u points to a number of questions to ask before starting a project, and how language matters. They refer to Warren Berger&#39;s article in the Harvard Business Review about one of the questions top innovators ask when confronted with a design challenge.</description>

      <description>Thirst Studios and UX Mastery kicked off their UXmas 2013 user experience design advent calendar. Every day throughout December in the lead-up to Christmas, a new ‘gift’ to the UX community will be revealed. It could be an article, a video, a sketch, or something else.

      <description>After repeatedly using a pattern of term + description to describe something, I wondered if other people in my Twitter-sphere used the same or similar language to describe a common artifact. My question started:
I was wondering if people used different terms to describe either drawings made in software or on paper that describe a screen view at a high level of abstraction that uses only lines and labels.
 Accompanied by this screenshot: It&#39;s interesting to learn that we use so many terms to describe essentially the same thing, although some of the confusion in this discussion might be with understanding what I meant by my question:</description>

      <title>How GitHub Uses &amp;amp;quot;Deprivation Testing&amp;amp;quot; To Hone Product Design</title>

      <description>Fastco interviewed Chrissie Brodigan, design and UX researcher at GitHub to talk about how they&#39;re using deprivation to study people&#39;s reaction to removing elements from a product.
The gist of the technique is to work with a set of participants who develop a pattern of use around a feature or design characteristic and journal their experience. After some time, at a point when they&#39;ve had time to be accustomed to that thing, they take away or alter it, and observe through the journal what the users&#39; reactions are to its removal.</description>

      <description>I can&#39;t imagine email ever being the right way to critique design, or give feedback as a client, but nevertheless it happens, and Julius Tarng, who works on the Branch app, came up with some good advice for those about to give email, and those about to receive it. I think the advice applies for any feedback that&#39;s not face to face to face including chat and in comments.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t like public speaking. I love talking to people one to one and in very small groups. But public speaking and me don&#39;t mix, and if you&#39;ve ever seen me speak, you probably agree. In the handful of times that I have spoken publicly, I think only two were really worth coming to see and hear. I believe the only reason the worthwhile talks were not utter failures was because I had something to share that I think people wanted to hear, and could get something out of.</description>

      <description>If you take a lot of screenshots on a Mac like me, you probably have a good workflow for doing it using something like LittleSnapper/Ember, Awesome Screenshot or Skitch. The biggest problem I&#39;ve had is that after I take a screenshot, I often want to do something with it. I can do this by just getting Cloud to watch and upload files passively, but I&#39;ve always wanted to save to my own server after just issuing one command to capture the page.</description>

      <description>Jackson Fox and Jeremy Fields did an excellent 2-part write on the use of &#34;infield&#34; labels at Viget. There are several techniques for placing labels inside the input box. For varying reasons we may want to avoid the label on top or side positioning, but as Jackson points out, the infield placement can be problematic. Part 1 talks about the problems using infield labels. Part 2 shows how they deal with the problem by using a visible tooltip that doesn&#39;t obscure the input, with a jsFiddle snippet to play with the code.</description>

He&#39;s looking at how to employ practical ideas that satisfy the business side as well as the people using it, which I&#39;m sure is something we all want to do on sites that sell a product or service. He plans to publish the newsletter monthly.</description>

      <description>About this template This is a template for doing desktop application design using Sketch, a vector illustration tool for the Mac. The idea for sharing this template is to give a quick starting point for anyone who wants to create their visual design comps in Sketch. When I started using Sketch to design and export controls for an iOS app, I quickly started liking the application, particularly the styling properties, simple vector editing and combination features, and the well thought-out grid and export capabilities.</description>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;m doing
I&amp;rsquo;m doing a review of customer support sites, looking mostly for software (desktop and web) and services-related sites that provide a customer support site for getting answers to questions, and viewing documentation and tutorials. Why I&amp;rsquo;m doing it
Some sites have better search capabilities for questions than others. Other sites do well at presenting documentation. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that there&amp;rsquo;s sometimes a difference in how companies handle giving answers to the most granular questions as opposed to presenting a unified view of a product via a manual-like experience.</description>

I spent a wonderful 3 months living on the side of a hill looking onto Mount Tamalpais in Marin with my family re-connecting with nature, and discovering the joy of living with only several bags of possessions and a new slate.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m spending my final full week as a Brooklynite and feeling the bitter sweet pain of saying goodbye, while looking hopefully towards the next chapter of my life. After 19 years as a New Yorker, I&amp;rsquo;m heading with my family to live in Marin County, CA. New York is a city that I&amp;rsquo;ve loved from childhood, and the only place I could see myself living as a young adult. With my head full of every cliché dream, I believed it was the place I needed to live to find myself.</description>

      <description>Designers prune. Left to its own devices, the mob will augment, accessorize, spam, degrade and noisify whatever they have access to, until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. It seems democratic and non-elitist to set it and forget it and let the users take over. But the tools we use (Wikipedia) and the brands we covet (Nike or Ducati) resolutely refuse to become democracies.

      <description>Light drop this week because I was out camping for most of it. Little tidbit about the Link Drop name. I like it because it reminds me of a record needle drop.

      <description>Hannah Donovan&amp;rsquo;s essay in A List Apart considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.
I&#39;ve been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement.</description>

Stephen Kenn: Inheritance collection LA designer learns of a military surplus facility and upcycles tons of fabric into furniture with a mid-century nod in form. The video tells the story of the vison and spirit of Kenn. I love videos like this, and the Made by Hand series, that show how a maker starts with a pure idea that is imbued with the creator&#39;s beliefs and turns it into a usable product.</description>

      <description>I got around to watching David Gelb&amp;rsquo;s documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi after seeing it making the rounds on the web repeatedly. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a documentary kick lately, and this has made it into the category of films I&amp;rsquo;d re-watch. The film looks at the life of celebrated sushi chef, Jiro Ono, whose small restaurant serves only sushi and requires a reservation 3 months in advance, and who is regarded as the most masterful sushi chef in Japan.</description>

      <description>An Unexpected Ass Kicking Great post by Joel Runyon, who talks about getting schooled by Russel Kirsch. 2 takeaways: 1) Nothing is withheld from us which we have conceived to do. 2) Do things that have never been done. The first meaning: if you’ve conceived something in your mind, decide to do it, and are willing to put in the work – nothing can stop you. The second is fairly self-explanatory but carries the extra weight of it coming from the guy who invented the very thing that’s letting me type these words out on the internet.</description>

      <description>protomoto is an excellent showcase of prototyping or wireframing tools created to helps designers find a tool that&amp;rsquo;s suited to the specific devices or platforms they are designing for. The site, developed by Paper &amp;amp; Equator, will be adding more filters in the future as they continue to evolve the resource, so that you can browse the tools based on features. Very cool.

      <description>Sergey Chikuyonok&amp;rsquo;s Smashing Magazine article on PNG optimization is an oldie, but I just found myself returning to use it for maybe the 4th time since I originally read it. I don&amp;rsquo;t do web graphics so frequently anymore, so I always return here to get reminded of things like the posterization layer in Photoshop. See also Sergey&amp;rsquo;s JPEG Optimization article.

      <description>Telling yourself, “Oh, you have all the time in the world, you have all the money in the world, you have all the colors in the palette you want, anything you want,” I mean, that just kills creativity.
&amp;#8212;Jack White
I was going through the parts I had highlighted in my Kindle version of Austin Kleon&#39;s book, Steal Like An Artist, and I keep thinking of how much I like this quote from musician Jack White, talking about using constraints to stay creative.</description>

&amp;#8212;Jeff Atwood
I didn&#39;t read Jeff Atwood&#39;s article about cat feeders right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It&#39;s also a terrific demonstration of what he&#39;s saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to satisfice with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it.</description>

I know that few people have the time or interest to do that, so I&#39;ve been looking at alternatives for them.
A month ago, Brad from JetPens contacted me to tell me that he started supplying a sketchbook from Maruman that I might like.</description>

      <description>I&#39;d like to talk about the one thing that&#39;s been consistent over the years—the genesis and power of creativity. ... It’s all about how you’re putting what you do together. The elements you’re using don’t matter. Purity of human expression and experience is not confined to guitars, to tubes, to turntables, to microchips. There’s no right way, no pure way of doing it—there’s just doing it.

      <description>This is a guide for binding your own sketchbooks. I offer it to you designers, developers, makers, and tinkerers out there who are looking for a way to physically connect to your practice of designing interfaces, or who maybe just want a fun and practical way to get your hands dirty.
I started making my own sketchbooks and pads a few years ago. At the time there weren&#39;t many options for interface sketching and storyboarding.</description>

I&#39;ve put my foot in my mouth a few times by pushing back on others&#39; ideas, and am well aware that being quick to react can be detrimental.

I&amp;rsquo;ve never read Theodore Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Citizenship in a Republic/Man in the Arena&amp;rdquo; speech before hearing it in this BoS2011 recap video. &amp;ldquo;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</description>

      <description>I made a minor update to the OmniGraffle UX Template. The grids were screwed up in the last update I made, so snapping wasn&#39;t working. Some guides were also pretty sloppy, so I cleaned those up as well to keep things nice and neat.
Thanks to Jayson Elliot for the heads up about the grid snapping problem.
Update your templates here.

      <description>Meaningful Transitions is the thesis project of Johannes Tonollo, an interface design student at the FH Potsdam, Germany. Johannes wrote his Thesis on &amp;quot;Transitions in the User Interface,&amp;quot; in which he analyzed how motion in the user interface can be a helpful extension to static elements to enhance the user experience.
The collection of transitions is clustered into 6 different categories: Orientation, Spatial Extension, Awaking Controls (Awakening?), Highlight, Feedback, and Feedforward.</description>

      <description>Usabilla is one of the remote, unmoderated usability test services I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed and used in the past (full disclosure: they also now sponsor this site). They&amp;rsquo;ve added mobile testing to their remote, unmoderated testing service. The new feature lets users participate by using their smartphones or tablets to test the screenshots or urls you specify in each task or scenario.
As with their past offering, participants are stepped through each scenario and asked to respond by adding markers to screens and notes/responses to your questions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in love with this Journal Bandolier made of recycled bike inner tubes, made by Cleverhands and sold on Etsy. The bandolier is a strap fitted with small loops for carrying pens, pencils, and other handy tools wrapped around a journal, planner, or other book. I ordered one for the small 3.5&amp;quot; wide Moleskine. Bandoliers for other notebook sizes available as well.

      <description>Adam Pritzker deftly combined this image of an Apple I and this Steve Jobs quote on design from an interview in 2000 that appeared in Fortune.
“In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.</description>

      <description>I find inspiration in the literature that examines games and play as factors in creating delightful and engaging experiences. I like to think of how this applies to products outside of the video gaming industry. I&#39;ve had Thomas Malone&#39;s 1981 paper, &#34;Heuristics for Designing Enjoyable Interfaces: Lessons from computer games&#34; on my desk for a while. I finally got around to reading it and found some interesting ideas that resonated with me.</description>

The character replacement one in particular will save you time. Although I tend to just clone an entire object&amp;rsquo;s style the style brush with W and OPT+W, you should definitely learn about cloning discrete styles with chicklets. You&amp;rsquo;ll wonder you never did.

      <description>Two great slides from Yiibu&#39;s presentation, Letting Go, a talk about design in an time of increasing disruption.
 &#34;Issuing your customers with something that is rough, incomplete, and possibly even substandard seems counterintuitive but there is growing evidence that people don&#39;t necessarily want the perfect product. They prefer to deal with something ragged around the edges that they can adapt or improve.&#34;

In the last year I&#39;ve gotten a lot of requests to replenish the inventory of wireframe and storyboard graphpaper notepads that I fulfilled via Amazon.com, and the wirebound sketch books. I feel bummed every time I tell people that I decided to get out of that little business.</description>

      <description>@nickf called me out for not having iPad templates in the Konigi OmniGraffle Wireframe Template, so I got off my lazy ass and added some since this thing hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in over 2 years! Added iPad Portrait 1 up, iPad Portrait 2 up, iPad Landscape 1 up. They have guides for 2x2 or 3x3 grid.
Note, this is for OmniGraffle Pro ONLY. You will not be able to edit shared layers to modify the headers and other templates.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/seth-godin-importance-domain-knowledge/</guid>
      <description>Seth Godin&#39;s blog often talks about where successful ideas come from, and in this post talks about bypassing the need to make huge leaps in innovation by synthesizing what we know and have learned from history, using Palm as the cautionary tale.
It&#39;s not enough to be aware of the domain you&#39;re working in, you need to understand it. Noticing things and being curious about how they work is the single most common trait I see in creative people.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;m working on this hand drawn font and looking at characters with diacritics is having a weird effect on me. While working on it, the ö character reminded me of something from my childhood and I had to remake it in type.
So if you can guess what this is by @ing me on Twitter or in G+ if we follow each other there, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a floppy disk notebook from my stash, and a few sketch pads.</description>

      <description>I like how Seth Godin states everything so clearly. Usually it&#39;s a pithy piece of advice about how to do the right thing, do right by your product, and thereby do right for the market by serving the right users with the product they want, and forgetting about trying to serve everyone else.
Here&#39;s one thought about really knowing your use case and putting it out front for the market to see, and letting it guide your conversation.</description>

      <description>Persona is a concept for a theoretical email client prototyped by Ali Seçkin Karayol, Marco Triverio, and Harsha Vardhan at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design. The prototype focusses email on people or conversations rather than presenting the typical data-dense tabular view of messages. The attachment view also offers a nice way of viewing all attached files in a gallery presentation. There are some compelling ideas for re-imagining the focus of email consumption here.</description>

      <description>I like to use HR tags. I use the technique in the first example below, but occasionally want a nicer separator, and hate having to use a graphic to show that chiseled aqua-style divider or to created the faded line of a gradient. Examples 2 and 3 use background gradients in webkit and mozilla. All versions of IE just show the solid rule. Normal Demo HTML &amp;amp; CSS &amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Seth Godin&#39;s blog entry, &amp;quot;The Grateful Dead and the Top 40,&amp;quot; looks at a band that only ever had 1 &amp;quot;hit record,&amp;quot; but who were very succesful at what they did. They may have not hit the Top 40 more than once, but one thing is true, they knew themselves as artists, and were true to that.
In terms of chart success, Elton John is probably the polar opposite of The Grateful Dead.</description>

      <description>Miratech observed the difference between reading an article in a newspaper and on an iPad in an eye tracking study. They concluded that readers are more likely to skim over articles on an iPad than in a newspaper.

The type of medium doesn&#39;t influence reading time when the text is short (like an article).
It is easier to assimilate and retain information read in a newspaper than on an iPad.</description>

      <description>Project Rimino is an interaction design project proposing a hypothetical e-paper mobile device. The project was created by Amid Moradganjeh, an interaction design student from Umea Institute of Design in Sweden, for his masters degree project on mobile experience design. The design is based on both observational and experimental design research methods. Watch the video below for the concept.

Some of the ideas are pretty exciting. I particularly like the emphasis on everyday tasks, utilizing the materials of the device to create minimal, task-focussed interfaces.</description>

      <description>Jared Spool talks about why designers who code are popular in Silicon Valley right now, and for the most part, it boils down to this. Small software and web startups value and are able to use a broader range of skillsets, because one of the highest priorities, especially for bootstrapped startups, is to ship while lean on resources.
Jared notes that those who don&#39;t think designers should know how to code say this dilutes the designer&#39;s value.</description>

I rarely do click-through prototypes, but if I have to, then I use Symbols and links in Mockups to make it painless. This is a speed-wireframing video I whipped up to demonstrate to customers in a few minutes what the experience of wireframing with Symbols is like.

      <title>Don&amp;acirc;��t Simplify the UX. Curate.</title>

      <description>Jason Toth of Viget discusses the danger of blind devotion to simplification in design, and writes about the role of UX designers as curators of content. He offers useful suggestions for how to play that role so we don&#39;t come off as content hackers.
I think the argument for facilitating curation is as apt for feature selection and design as it is for content. I view the role of someone doing content strategy as being able to take in the glut of information for analysis and providing direction for how to deliver the message with greater efficiency and maybe at times, poetry.</description>

      <description>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”

      <title>Why Invest in Sketching?</title>

      <description>Jumping in and immediately starting to build the product, even if it does get completed and ship, is almost guaranteed to produce a mediocre product in which there is little innovation or market differentiation. When you have only one kick at the can, the behaviour of the entire team and process is as predictable as it will be pedestrian.
&amp;#8212;Bill Buxton in Sketching the User Experience
Buxton writes in this passage on the impact of iterative sketching on risk, exploration and innovation.</description>

      <description>I love these two posts by Mark McGuiness on the 99% on why eccentricity and how daily routine helps trigger creativity.
He points out three characteristics of a hypnotic trigger:
Uniqueness - it should be something (or a combination of things) you don&#39;t associate with other activities, otherwise the effect will be diluted.
Emotional intensity - the kind you experience when you&#39;re really immersed in creative work.
Repetition - the more times you experience the unique trigger in association with the emotions, the stronger the association becomes.</description>

      <description>Sketching interfaces is a path focussed on generating many ideas and finding the right design. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to adapt the activity of physically sketching on paper to get the same results in Mockups. On the Balsamiq UX blog, I wrote about a technique I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with to do sketchboards in Mockups using a Symbols library. http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2011/04/28/sketching-in-mockups/</description>

Occasionally I&#39;m asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.
I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I&#39;m familiar with.</description>

      <description>Don Lehman&amp;rsquo;s MORE/REAL Stylus Cap is a cool iPad stylus project looking for funding via Kickstarter. The idea is to create a cap with a conductive tip that will fit over a Sharpie, Bic, or Fineliner pen. Lehman&amp;rsquo;s introductory video below shows the stylus cap at work.
 Looks fantastic and simple, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have one fewer thing to carry with you because it acts as pen and stylus. Sweet. You can help fund the project and reserve a cap by heading to the Kickstarter page.</description>

Update: 
Mine arrived and I have to say that this is the nicest dry erase board I have now. It&#39;s made on hard particle board, similar to what you&#39;d find on a clipboard, so it feels great in the hands.</description>

I found 52 weeks&#39; recent post about sketching, and loved the encouraging reminder for UX designers. I&#39;ll quote, because Joshua Brewer says it so well.</description>

      <description>Ryan Singer at 37signals explains code refactoring to designers so that they can use it correctly in a design context.
Designers sometimes use the word “refactor” in a loose way. I think they overhear the word from programmers without getting the precise meaning. This article will introduce the term to designers so they can gain the same advantages that programmers have from a clear understanding.
How do designers loosely understand refactoring?</description>

Ben Kutil also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq&amp;rsquo;s site.

      <description>This is one of the most practical uses of augmented reality I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. Word Lens translates text you capture from an iPhone&amp;rsquo;s camera to another language. I think it&amp;rsquo;s only Spanish-English/English-Spanish at the moment, and $4.99 per language. If you&amp;rsquo;re skeptical, as some YouTubers seem to be in the comments, you can see an example of the translation I did on my phone of an English magazine page to Spanish.</description>

It allows you to reuse groups of controls in order to create templates, page masters, and libraries of re-usable components. This can be done globally for all of your projects, or locally within a single project. You can create symbols from the top down and the bottom up.

      <description>The iClooly is the pen I&amp;rsquo;ve been using most for quick sketches on the iPad, but for longer sketches and for drawing the handwritten font I&amp;rsquo;m making in iFontMaker, the short stick kind of sucks. Extending the iClooly stick is an easy hack that almost doesn&amp;rsquo;t merit a post: rip off the back, take apart a mechanical pencil, and mash the two together.
Verbose version: Remove the clicky end and the spring inside, making sure the brush is pressed down and the bristles exposed.</description>

      <description>Sarah Sampsel wrote about designing the Washington Post iPad app, in 2 entries describing a little bit about the process. The first entry describes the types of interaction, visual design, and brand issues she had to consider when designing for the device. The second shows a few wireframes of the evolution of the home screen design.
Would have been lovely to also see some of the sketches, but it&#39;s awesome that Sarah shared not just final wireframes, but a series of wireframes showing the iterations.</description>

      <description>This notepad table is the coolest little piece of furniture. Looks like it was made for kids. Furniture you can draw on would be great in any studio lounging and waiting areas.

      <title>Where Good Ideas Come From, by Steven Johnson</title>

      <description>Chance favors the connected mind.
I just picked up Steven Berlin Johnson&#39;s Where Good Ideas Come From after watching this sketch-note summarization of the ideas in the book.
 I became a fan of Steven&#39;s after reading the New Yorker article &#34;Watching TV Makes you Smarter&#34; and his book, Everything Bad is Good for You. This one looks like it will be an interesting read. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s full of stories of long drawn out infancy of ideas, and the collisions and connections that make ideas succeed.</description>

      <title>CSS Tooltips and Speech Bubbles</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using some new CSS techniques lately, and thought it was time to start experimenting with ideas. One thing that I thought was really cool was that you could use the :before and :after pseudo-classes to create boxes before and after an element and position those. I did that on the little screenshot images on this product page, to position the little + icons.
I was also interested in how I could replace some of the jQuery techniques I was using to make tooltips in myBalsamiq.</description>

      <description>Love this post on /Film showing a few artifacts from J.K. Rowling&amp;rsquo;s creative process. Rowling uses spreadsheets she draws by making grid lines on plain paper, creating columns to outline a book&amp;rsquo;s plot along a timeline, with months progressing downward. The initial columns contains a title and blurb about the plot, and further columns contain info about sub-plots. The excerpt below describes this in detail:
Rowling outlines each chapter in detail including which month of the school year it takes place in, the title and the plot.</description>

In addition to doing interface design on the product (myBalsamiq mostly up to now) I also get to be the &amp;quot;webmaster.&amp;quot; :) What that means in our small startup is doing the user research, interface design, visual design, and front end development. If you know me, you know that I dig getting to do more than one thing, so that&amp;rsquo;s a win.</description>

Dark Patterns &amp;hellip; are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. The purpose of this site is to catalogue various common types of Dark Pattern, and to name and shame organizations that use them.</description>

      <title>WhatUsersDo.com Review on 90 Percent of Everything</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/whatusersdocom-review-90-percent-everything/</guid>
      <description>Harry Brignull did a thorough review of WhatUsersDo.com, a UK-based remote, unmoderated, qualitative usability testing service. To use the service, you pay £25-£30 per participant and you get back screen recordings with audio of them thinking aloud during the tasks. The test participants are chosen from a pool of users paid to take usability tests, similar to usertesting.com.
As Brignull notes, this is possibly valuable to companies with little experience doing usability testing on their own before, but is less likely to be of value to companies with the experience and budget for doing moderated usability research on their own, or with a usability research consultancy.</description>

      <description>I swear I&#39;ve answered this question a dozen times, so I&#39;m capturing to refer people in the future. The tree control in my OmnGraffle Wireframe Stencil is a godawful hack that uses tabs and arrow characters. Copying and pasting the arrows, however, screws up the formatting. OmniGraffle just doesn&#39;t make this kind of manipulation of text all that easy and I haven&#39;t found an ideal solution, but if you want to learn how I do it, read on.</description>

The more I deal with the work as something of my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is as something that is compelling, interesting, and sustaining.</description>

1. It&#39;s important to know who is in charge. Just like training a pet, a designer need to establish a rapport with clients that mixes trust and expertise.
2. Pay attention to the tail.</description>

Succinctly describes the major features enabled by HTML 5 that you need to be aware of: Canvas and video elements, offline storage and geolocation. The graph below shows a snapshot of current support and intent to support in web browsers. Shows that IE is well behind the field in terms of readiness as we speak, but IE 9 intends to support.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m hoping, since there is some space on the individual pages for content, that we&amp;rsquo;ll see a little more discussion about process and design thinking here rather than mere visuals of design artifacts. It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see more people showing how they explore ideas with sketches and wireframes.

      <description>This seems the ideal solution for my iPad sketching needs. A few days ago, when I thought of hacking my Pogo Sketch, I started researching all of the options for creating my own drawing tool for the iPad&amp;rsquo;s capacitive touch screen, and was researching the styli that were available. I came across the odd design of the iClooly and thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out of curiosity.
I had low expectations, but was surprised by how well it works for iPad sketching.</description>

      <description>I blogged about what I thought could possibly make a better stylus recently and thought I&amp;rsquo;d sketch what I was thinking. The above picture shows how I think you could hack the Pogo Sketch stylus so it will glide a little more smoothly on the iPad screen. The capacitive foam creates a little too much friction to feel natural to me. I drilled a small hole in the foam and inserted a plastic nib from an old pressure-sensitive screen stylus into the center.</description>

      <description>Pen and paper are still superior, but iPad sketching is good enough to leave those behind.
The topic of UI sketching on the iPad is coming up pretty regularly for UI designers. People want to know how it feels and if it&#39;s going to replace pen/pencil and paper. After a few months using as many drawing apps as I can get my hands on, I find that it&#39;s more than adequate for UI sketching needs.</description>

      <description>The model for sustaining customer loyalty is reverse engineering user awesomeness.
Peldi pointed me to a video of Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s presentation at Business of Software 09, where she talks about sustaining passionate and loyal customers. Positioning and generating sustainable relationships is not what you think it should be about. It&amp;rsquo;s about user benefits, and not features&amp;ndash;about how they feel about themselves in the context of what you provide them.</description>

If you haven&#39;t seen it, there&#39;s a great discussion on taste for creators. This is Ira Glass from This American Life talking about story telling, and how we get into creative work because we love it and we have good taste. He talks about the gap in the beginning when we&#39;re trying to make stuff, that turns out short of our expectations.</description>

This seems similar to a common theme I come across when designers talk about their process&amp;ndash;framing/ideating, reframing/ideating, selection/refining. Buxton also refers to this, citing Stuart Pugh&amp;rsquo;s idea by illustrating the expanding/contracting nature of a designer&amp;rsquo;s concept selection, which I find easy to map to sketching-&amp;gt;wireframing as well.</description>

      <title>UP THERE and Appreciation of Craft</title>

      <description>With the glut of anti-craft sentiment I hear and read so often, I think it fitting to post an entry about the love of one&#39;s work, drawing from a craft outside of our own.
UP THERE is a beautiful documentary about the slow, laborious, and fading craft of hand-painted advertising murals. This is the NY I love. This is the type of appreciation of craft that I admire.
 I feel like the humble young man towards the end that looks at it this way.</description>

      <description>Because of @fred_beecher I setup this iPad Sketch Group on Flickr so we can share our UI sketches. I&#39;m going to slowly post what I work on there.
Freehand design sketching on the iPad is for UX designers. Any app that lets you do freehand user interface sketches, either using finger tips or a capacitive stylus like the Pogo Sketch is what we&#39;re sharing here. If you drop non-iPad sketches, they will be booted.</description>

The good news is that Jeff Parks did an amazing job of capturing the sessions and producing audio podcasts, which are now available via Boxes and Arrows or by subscribing to the podcast via iTunes. Currently the keynotes and all of the sessions from Day 1 are available.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling people how much I dig Adobe&amp;rsquo;s free Ideas app and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro for sketching on the iPad. Craighton Berman&amp;rsquo;s Fueled by Coffee sketchblog will give you an idea of what sketches can look like using these tools. Ideas is super simple and smoothens your lines so things look naturally drawn.
I&#39;m really loving it. The adjustment is taking time, and it&#39;s not as quick as pen and paper, but it&#39;s slightly more natural using a Pogo Sketch Stylus.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/salacious-swapping-design-swap/</guid>
      <description>I love the idea of Design Swap, even if it reminds me of Wife Swap, key parties, the swinging &amp;lsquo;70s and that movie Ice Storm. It&amp;rsquo;s better, because it&amp;rsquo;s an exhibitionist, one-to-one CSS Zen Garden style swap of designs between two designer&amp;rsquo;s sites. And we get to be the voyeurs. Salacious.
It&#39;s a shame that they didn&#39;t pick up on the wife swap theme like I did, and go with a &#39;70s disco, swinging aesthetic.</description>

 I knew that it would be much more like an iPod Touch than a Mac netbook. But what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know until I &amp;ldquo;found out what it really was,&amp;rdquo; to quote Seth Meyer, was that it is for me better and more than I want from a netbook.</description>

      <description>I saw Dave Gray demonstrate his visual alphabet at SXSWi last year. If you haven&#39;t seen him demonstrate this, you might want to watch this video now. In the video he illustrates for us how sketching is just combining forms and lines, and all you really need to be able to come up with pictures is to see and use these basic shapes.

Don&#39;t live in the old world of pushing all your quality content on the visitor at once because they&#39;ve only got 4 seconds before their attention drops (or whatever other statistic is doing the rounds at present).</description>

      <description>Jon Phillips writes about how the user experience of restaurant flow can be redesigned by illustrating the flow in a cafeteria-style space from entry, order and pickup to seating and exit. In his great diagrams he shows how the orginal flow frustrated diners (users) and could be easily re-designed to consider a flow that was immediately understandable&amp;ndash;the design he experienced made him feel stupid. Sound familiar?
I think about interior spaces like lines at Whole Foods, where sometimes it makes absolutely no sense (I&#39;m looking at you Columbus Circle) and where other lines seem to have considered this (Union Square sometimes feels efficient).</description>

      <description>Roberto Verganti&#39;s article in HBR, &amp;quot;User-Centered Innovation Is Not Sustainable,&amp;quot; discusses how focussing on what user&#39;s say they want isn&#39;t a strategy for innovation. Not news to you, but his take looks at what that means regarding innovation from a sustainability perspective. I found it thought-provoking in other ways as well. The main idea is this. Forward-looking designers and business or policy decision makers may have a greater role and influence regarding designing sustainability products than customers.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a little late on getting to this one, but wanted to post before I forgot because it is a great topic for early and mid-career web designers. Matt (emenel) reacted to Mark Boulton&#39;s thoughts about whether or not designers needed to know html.
Matt summarizes what he believes:
As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making.</description>

User experiences are your everyday experiences—anything from operating a car, to making a pot of coffee, to ordering a pair of shoes online. User experience is the result of your interactions with a product or service, specifically how it’s delivered and its related artifacts according to the design.</description>

      <description>Microsoft has been doing some interesting work with Bing Maps. The augmented reality demos at the TED conference this week generated some buzz. The photo and video overlays were cool.
&amp;ldquo;We see this space, three-dimensional environment as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out,&amp;rdquo; says Bing Maps&amp;rsquo; Blaise Aguera y Arcas. &amp;ldquo;Maps, directions are really just one of them.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Sorry for the downtime. Konigi went down for most of the day yesterday because a spike in traffic and number of database requests caused the databases to be taken offline. With our web host&#39;s help, we&#39;ve moved Konigi to a virtual private server, and now we&#39;re able to run our own database rather than share database resources and limit the number of requests we can make. These are all good problems, and the growing pains are to be expected I suppose.</description>

      <description>Will Evans shows us how he sketches and wireframes interfaces in this cool video, which is a nice preview of what you may see in his upcoming talk on &amp;ldquo;The Right Way to Wireframe&amp;rdquo; at IXD10. Incidentally, he&amp;rsquo;s using OmniGraffle with our free wireframe stencils. Will says this about wireframing:
Increasingly, as designers of interactive systems (spaces, processes and products for people), we find ourselves stretching the limits of communication tools to explore and document what it will be like to interact with the things we design.</description>

      <description>Craig Villamor and Luke Wroblewski summarize the new interactions we&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing in the iPad.
During Apple&#39;s 90 minute unveiling of the iPad this week, a lot of new multi-touch interactions were shown off. But they went by fast. So as a service to digital product designers everywhere, we took the time to extract 8 minutes of new user interface demos from the iPad keynote. Now you can quickly just catch the UI in action on Apple&#39;s new native iPad and iWork applications.</description>

      <description>Napkee gets an update with iPhone controls and now covers 100% of what you find in Balsamiq Mockups. What I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about are the export settings. Under the HTML settings you can now define a title for your exported files, a new name for the Icons folder and you can specify an external CSS file that will be included in each export. More info on the release here.

      <description>Instead of throwing in my 2 cents on the &amp;quot;wireframes suck&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lorem ipsum ain&amp;rsquo;t so bad&amp;quot; discussions I&amp;rsquo;ll just echo what Joshua Porter (@bokardo) has to say on the matter:
Lorem Ipsum, wireframes, personas, etc are just tactics. The only thing that matters is: Do people love what you built?
Amen, brother. Here&#39;s 1 cent... I agree with Karen about Lorem Ipsum.

      <description>Explain IA is a contest created by the Information Architecture Institute to find the explanation of information architecture. Will be interesting to see what people come up with. I&amp;rsquo;d especially like to see the explanation that explains IA in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms in a way that my non-techie mother could understand.
What is it? Why is it important? What does it mean to you? Some folks may offer a definition in 140 characters or less, while others will use this opportunity to tell a story (using text, pictures, audio, and/or video) about their relationship to IA.</description>

      <description>Rosenfeld Media have a book site and Ning community up for John Ferrara&amp;rsquo;s forthcoming book, Playful Design: Creating Game Expderiences in Everyday Interfaces.
Game design is a sibling discipline to software and Web design, but they&#39;re siblings that grew up in different houses. They have much more in common than their perceived distinction typically suggests, and user experience practitioners can realize enormous benefit by exploiting the solutions that games have found to the real problems of design.</description>

      <description>UXFind is a mashup that uses Google Custom Search Engine and Google App Engine. It provides a search engine tailored for User Experience pros. It indexes over 200 of user experience web sites and blogs. Oddly, they index my old blog iaslash, but not Konigi, so I guess the sources might not be so fresh. It&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to do this in the past too, to just limit to sources I trust.</description>

      <description>Drawter has been sitting in my tabs for a few days now, and I keep coming back to play with it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I watched the screencast, however, that I really got to see how beautifully it generates markup and css.
Drawter is a web-based xhtml/css layout tool written in JavaScript using the jQuery library. It allows you to literally draw your website&#39;s code by dragging boxes within the onscreen canvas to create divs using the dimensions of your rectangles, and then to edit each div&#39;s style properties within floating inspectors.</description>

      <description>BiDi Screen was demonstrated at SIGGRAPH Asia this year. It is a thin, depth-sensing LCD for 3D interaction using light fields.
The BiDi Screen is an example of a new type of I/O device that possesses the ability to both capture images and display them. This thin, bidirectional screen extends the latest trend in LCD devices, which has seen the incorporation of photo-diodes into every display pixel. Using a novel optical masking technique developed at the Media Lab, the BiDi Screen can capture lightfield-like quantities, unlocking a wide array of applications from 3-D gesture interaction with CE devices, to seamless video communication.</description>

      <description>Iain Lamb&amp;rsquo;s Typograph is cool tool that allows you to explore the relationship between scale and rhythm by modifying the properties of typographic elements in a page of sample text.
It sets out to explore how two, intertwined concepts, often playful but sometimes cheeky, can be encouraged to dance in web pages. Drag the colored boxes along the scale to throw these words anew. For the most part, this text is just a libretto for the performance you are about to play upon it.</description>

In the OmniGraffle version, all icons have been converted to vector format so they are editable in OmniGraffle. You can now modify the shapes and easily change their colors. The vector icons also reduce file size of OG documents. In both OmniGraffle and EPS/PNG versions, I&#39;ve cleaned up all existing icons for consistency and added new icons including: globe, wrench/screwdriver, lightning bolt, spaces, desktop, gun sight, cloud, bug, books, presentation, twitter bird, bullhorn, megaphone, rocket, windows, mac, and more.</description>

I tend to talk about them here because of the questions they raise about whether a technique is worth implementing or if it does more harm than help. Straight forward and familiar are the safe route. Sometimes experiments lead to better ways of doing things, other times they seem like they&amp;rsquo;re gratuitous.
I came across an interesting, if problematic experiment to convert form fields into editable fields that are masked table cells until each input is in focus.</description>

      <description>I finally made some time to read through Luke Wroblewski&amp;rsquo;s excellent review of the changes in the Apple store&amp;rsquo;s redesigned checkout form. According to Wroblewski, &amp;quot;&amp;hellip;retail sales data shows that Mac sales were up 21% year-over-year in the months of October and November. So it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to note that Apple&amp;rsquo;s primary online sales channel (Web-based checkout) was redesigned during this time.
I wasn&#39;t surprised that the single page checkout form is an improvement over the paged version.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&#39;ve been working on an html prototyping toolkit that&#39;s in its infancy, and available to play with in pre-release form here on Konigi. What you also may know is that I hope to put the code in a repository so that people can contribute UI component markup/css/js to it, but what I&#39;ve got is not mature enough yet.
A few people have already started sharing their ideas and tips with me and I&#39;ve felt like it&#39;s kind of a waste to have some of these discussions happen offline, so I want to step out and start these discussions in a wider venue.</description>

      <description>Basil Safwat does a very thorough comparison of the the tabs in Mac Safari and Chrome, pointing out the subtleties in the close button positioning and behavior. While Mac close icons are on the left by convention, Chrome positions them to the right of the tab and keeps them visible, while Safari positions them to the left and only displays the close icon on hover. I initially had to relearn the close button position because Firefox also places them on the right.</description>

      <description>The Plan I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of two things a lot with the holidays arriving. The first is, how can I provide a discount on Konigi stuff to my friends who use the notepads and sketchbooks. The second is, how can I find a way to make my Christmastime donations interesting. When I was an avid Lala trader a few years ago, I tried to see if I could get one of the many CDs sleeves I marked back and vowed to make my donations coincide with the event.</description>

      <description>Google launched a new behavior on the search page that hides everything but the logo and search form on load, and fades in the rest of the surrounding interface when the user moves the mouse. The idea is to give focus to search for the primary use case, where a user hits the page and starts typing without moving the mouse. They talk about the new behavior on the Google Blog.</description>

Protokit was an experimental project to develop a toolkit for creating HTML prototypes. It uses the following open source libraries and plugins: Blueprint, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Templates, and iXEdit. More information about the included libraries and their licensing agreements can be found in theREADME file.
Version 0.1 was the preliminary version and is very rough.</description>

      <description>This an article from March 09 by Kevin Vigneault of Viget that explores some techniques using Javascript to create more usable password inputs in forms. The ideas range from using a checkbox or button to temporarily show the password or changing type from text to password when the input is not in focus. Great ideas.

Uses the familiar I&amp;rsquo;m a customer/I&amp;rsquo;m new here radios that we know from Amazon, but positions it before the password field, which I find an improvement over the Amazon implementation. Lots of ideas in the comments.

Using Templates I&amp;rsquo;m using a jQuery template for creating columns in a grid. Columns look like this:

 {cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; grid layout container {col12} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column {/col} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; closed column {col12last} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; 12 unit column last in container {/col} {/cols} &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; end of container  You can try out the prototypes I&amp;rsquo;m playing with here:</description>

      <description>Simon Collison writes about the different forms of prototyping in ErskineLabs&amp;rsquo; Process Toolbox, describing the benefits of paper, wireframe, and browser prototypes.
As much as all parties may talk about requirements and argue over features, often they won’t really “get it” until they can see the concept represented visually, and understand its exact behaviour. This brings us on to various methods of prototyping.

Renowned graphic designer Michael Bierut claims that he&amp;rsquo;s not creative. Instead, he likens his job to that of a doctor who tends to patients – &amp;ldquo;the sicker, the better.&amp;rdquo; Digging into the 86 notebooks he&amp;rsquo;s kept over the course of his career, Bierut walks us through 5 projects – from original conception to final execution – extracting a handful of simple lessons (e.</description>

Ambient information and notification is killing me; so much so I&#39;m mostly avoiding email, I&#39;m disabling Growl notifications for apps, and looking at stuff like Tweetie on my own time rather than leaving it always on. I have to admit that I occasionally have a hard time focusing on tasks and have sometimes put more effort into tweaking my systems for getting things done than I should.</description>

They did this by simply requiring that real eggs be used in making cakes, rather than incorporating powered egg, and marketed this as a benefit.</description>

      <description>Bill Buxton&#39;s &#34;Multi-Touch System I have Known and Loved&#34; has been updated as of Sept. 2009. The article provides examples and a history of the multi touch systems Buxton has been involved with or known about over the years. Multi-touch technologies have a long history. To put it in perspective, my group at the University of Toronto was working on multi-touchin 1984 (Lee, Buxton &amp;amp; Smith, 1985), the same year that the first Macintosh computer was released, and we were not the first.</description>

      <description>PhotoSketch is an online tool created by five students from Tsinghua University in China and the National University of Singapore. It creates storyboards from sketches by finding &amp;amp; stitching background images &amp;amp; item layers.
We present a system that composes a realistic picture from a simple freehand sketch annotated with text labels. The composed picture is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement
with the sketch and text labels; these are found by searching the Internet.</description>

      <description>Peter Bregman writes about how finding the simplest solution provides the most effective path to change. In his story he talks about how changing one thing, one habit or pattern of behavior, permitted him to be effective at losing weight. This simple strategy contrasts with the multitude of diet books that suggest entire regimine of change in order to lose weight.
It&amp;rsquo;s a great tale that Bregman uses to illustrate how simplifying a process or dealing with a challenge can sometimes be most effectively handled by reducing it to its essence, and devoting 100% of energy on a singular action.</description>

Audi A4 Car Configurator by Neue Digitale / Razorfish in collaboration with Realtime Technology AG. Showcased at this year’s IAA - the world’s leading automotive fair. The application allows multiple users to configure an Audi A4 simultaneously by changing the car&amp;rsquo;s paint finishes, rims and by selecting and coloring style package components. The configured A4 is experienced in an immersive 3d environment, in which users can navigate seamlessly by zooming and panning using a multitouch-enabled interface</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m excited for the penetration of touch interfaces on higher resolution desktop applications, which will start to spread at a much greater rate to a wider audience when we see low cost devices like tablets and touch screen desktops at netbook prices.</description>

      <description>Caterina Fake, founder of Flickr and Hunch, talks about why working hard isn&amp;rsquo;t as important as working on the right things. Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;you have to work smarter not harder.&amp;rdquo;
Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be.</description>

      <title>John Maeda on Simplicity at Apple, and the Future of Design</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/john-maeda-simplicity-apple-and-future-design/</guid>
      <description>John Maeda wrote a short article for Huffington Post about simplicity and humanizing design, what it has meant for the software developed on Apple products, and what it means for the future. The respect so many designers have for Apple is possibly bourne out of reverence for the philosophies that lead to reduction, simplicity, and the humanizing of user interfaces. Maeda talks about Jonathan Ive in this regard, citing his ability to make something real and human by getting his hands dirty.</description>

      <description>The paper prototype is generally used as a design tool and even usability testing tool, but the folks at IG Index have figured out a creative way to use sketches and paper prototypes as a communication tool in place of wireframes for demonstrating interaction to development teams. Martin Belam posted video from UX London 09 of Jane Austin, Chris Neale and Frances Eida discussing this simple method of taking wireframe/storyboard sketches or paper prototypes, and creating stop-motion animation to demonstrate interface.</description>

      <description>Larva Labs&amp;rsquo; Intelligent Home Screen is a home screen replacement for Google Android devices that provides an information stream or feed. It divides the stream into 2 panels: private information on top (messages, calendar events) and public information on bottom (stock quotes, news). It provides color-coded category markers, and a draggable menubar that allows the user to selectively change the volume of information between top and bottom lists, and when pushed to a single end, provides focus on that category.</description>

      <description>Fred Beecher did an informal usability test of 2 conversion apps for the iPhone&amp;ndash;Convert and Covertbot&amp;ndash;and wrote up a thought provoking review regarding the relationship between playfulness and usability. Convertbot could be viewed as the more playful and whimsical of the 2 apps. He writes:
Fun isn’t always the new usable. There are situations in which usability is more important than playfulness and those in which it’s the other way around.</description>

      <description>Wearecolorblind.com is a website about colorblindness created by Tom van Beveren. Van Beveren discusses good and bad examples of interfaces, charts and diagrams with respect to how they are viewed by color-blind users. He also provides patterns and suggestions for improving their accessibility. Would be excellent to pass some of the examples through some of the simulators I recommend.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Usabilla for some time now as a beta tester with the expectation of utilizing it on several projects. They&amp;rsquo;ve continued to make improvements to the app, with the help of our feedback. They&amp;rsquo;ve also posted new information on their site to familiarize users with their product. This is a review of my recent test with the latest revisions.
Creating Tests The process is still quite simple: 1) Create a new test, 2) Add pages to test either from images you upload or using URLs, 3) Use the pre-defined tasks and add your own tasks, 4) Invite users to participate.</description>

      <description>Generally speaking I have 2 gripes with wireframes. One is that they&#39;re very limited and come with issues in terms of communicating design. Secondly, they&#39;re not fast and flexible enough as communication artifacts.
HTML wireframes and prototypes provide some relief from some of the issues, and I&#39;d like to hear what other people are looking for when doing HTML wireframes in order to fix and overcome the limitations of wireframes made in graphics software.</description>

      <description>Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz&amp;rsquo;s estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.
The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not terribly newsworthy, but Facebook&amp;rsquo;s design team announced that they&amp;rsquo;ve stopped rounding corners on all elements. I noticed, however, that they kept the slight (3px?) rounding of names in the To: field of the messaging section. That somehow feels like a natural place for an exception to rounding corners for some reason. You know, so you don&amp;rsquo;t get impaled when backspacing in the field. Kidding. This is a quote from their announcement.</description>

      <description>Brandon Walkin&amp;rsquo;s article &amp;ldquo;Managing UI Complexity&amp;rdquo; offers some excellent pointers or reminders of concepts and techniques that help reduce complexity in an interface, including progressive diclosure, contextual actions, aligment and hierarchy. There&amp;rsquo;s an abundance of examples with screenshots and deconstruction of interfaces to demonstrate the techniques in practice.

      <description>[I]f you make it easy to talk to me, I will immediately be a lot more likely to keep talking.
Zeus Jones has a great write up about using conversational language and cues to invite users through interactions. The deconstruction of the lazy trial/registration process in Tumblr is used to demonstrate how this type of engagement makes the learning process natural and inviting. The discussion picks up on the Cluetrain meme of markets as conversations, positing that systems are conversations, and turning front ends into actors that use conversational language as interface.</description>

      <description>Keith Lang, co-founder of plasq.com, wrote a fantastic article for Think Vitamin about UX Myths. It&amp;rsquo;s full of references and examples debunking stuff we hear repeated enough times that they begin to go unquestioned.
The top 10 UX myth list:
 The Design Has to be Original People Read People Know What They Like Design Always with Implementation in Mind Can’t Decide? Make it a Preference If you Have Great Search, You Don’t Need Great Information Architecture UX Design Stops at the Edges of the Product Design to Avoid Clicks People Don’t Change If the Design is a Good One, You Don’t Need to Test It  Some of these become so ingrained, that it takes a lot of effort to convince clients or colleagues otherwise.</description>

      <description>Thanks for showing off your sick fast skills, Nick, and shaming us all. Oh, and it looks like that&amp;rsquo;s going to be a really useful site. I didn&amp;rsquo;t miss that.
You can download the OmniGraffle wireframe stencil Nick is using here for free, by the way. ;)

      <title>Automatically generate table of contents using jQuery</title>

      <description>Janko at Warp Speed demonstrates a technique using jQuery to provide a navigable table of contents menu using the headings in your page content. I particularly like the method he&amp;rsquo;s come up with for displaying headings to show the proportion of content for each section relative to the whole. I think you could do some nice styling to display the blocks as small multiples of proportion and scale in the margin.</description>

      <description>CSS-Tricks wrote up a tutorial demonstrating how to use CSS clipping to use image sprite on inline elements that flow with content. This is a nice little technique for small icons that you want to come immediately after text, for example. Check it out.

You start by entering your site url, and selecting regions of your page design to be used in the mobile template, using their online template editor. For many sites, one template may be sufficient to serve all of your page types. After selecting regions, you may change their order in preview mode, as well as add custom HTML and modify CSS.</description>

      <description>Fred Beecher wrote the excellent article &amp;ldquo;The iPhone is Not Easy to Use: A New Direction for User Experience&amp;rdquo; on Johnny Holland to talk about why the iPhone is not easy to use (at first), and why it changes the game for user experience designers. The examples illustrate how gestural interfaces are hidden, and lack the affordances of physical buttons. But the real story here is how the iPhone brings one thing to the experience that is more important than usability&amp;#8212;fun.</description>

      <description>Fred Beecher wrote what he thinks are the nine essential characteristics you must possess to make a good software user experience designer, in reaction to a comment made about skills an IA should possess. It&#39;s an excellent read for those listing qualifications and evaluating UX Designers for hire, and a great list of qualities for job-seekers to demonstrate during interviews.
 A Deep Understanding of Human Psychology &amp;amp; Research Methods Competence in the Basics of Graphic Design An Awareness of and Interest in Technology Verbal &amp;amp; Visual Communication Skills Moderate Familiarity with Business, Deep Familiarity with Your Business The Ability to Quickly Learn a Subject Matter Area Mediation, Facilitation, &amp;amp; Translation Skills Creativity &amp;amp; Vision Passion  Elizabeth Buie also added a familiarity with HCI literature, and undboubtedly with HCI history, which I think should be there as well.</description>

      <description>Jonathan Snook shows a CSS technique for text rotation, which is supported in Webkit browsers, Firefox 3.5+, and IE 5.5+. Should be useful for ideas the little rotated year displays in the demo, but for me this would also be incredibly useful in dense angled headings for tables.

      <description>Plasq designer, Keith Lang, recounts the story from computer folklore of how the rounded rectangle came to dominate the Mac OS, and discusses its effect on visual cognition. He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of Visual Perception to offer his opinion.
A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle.</description>

So you’re thinking about becoming a designer? If I could tell you only one thing about going into the field, my advice would be ___________ .
 The suggestions ranged from the philosophical to the pragmatic. Below are the ones that resounded with me. Focus on empathy and understanding problems  Being empathetic helps designers create things that move people.</description>

      <description>SEOmoz user chenry posted some i8nteresting data showing captcha&amp;rsquo;s effect on conversion rates vs. reduction in spam. Chenry was given the task of eliminating spam that was being submitted through a web form. Disliking the captcha solution, he decided run a test to compare the data after adding captcha for a period of time, with data captured after turning captcha off. He made the following observation:
From the data you can see that with CAPTCHA on, there was an 88% reduction in SPAM but there were 159 failed conversions.</description>

      <description>Well, it&#39;s been a hell of a morning. As you know, Konigi allows registered users to post to the blog, showcase, tools, and wiki sections. Up to now, all user submissions have been appropriate, but last night a registered user posted spam content to the blog. This is largely because I missed one configuration option--spam checking on blog/notebook entries.
That user has been banned/blocked, but for the time being I&#39;m adding a few measures in place to prevent this from happening again:</description>

      <description>Social Design Notes has collected a list of design manifestos from the past 100 years, largely drawn from Mario Piazza’s presentation at the Più Design Può conference in Florence. Since the days of radical printer-pamphleteers, design and designers have a long history of fighting for what’s right and working to transform society. The rise of the literary form of the manifesto also parallels the rise of modernity and the spread of letterpress printing.</description>

      <description>Dustin Curtis did an interesting experiment with a short call to action at the bottom of his pages, asking users to follow him on Twitter. Comparing the results shows that direct, but informally worded calls to action, and (ugh) using a literal call out like the word &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rdquo; had a pretty significant impact. As the forcefulness and personal identifiability of the phrase increased, the number of clicks likewise increased. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rdquo; identifies the reader directly, &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; implies an obligation, and &amp;ldquo;follow me on twitter&amp;rdquo; is a direct command.</description>

Don’t forget the usability basics. Jakob Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics are as relevant now as they were in 1999. I stress this because I looked at the Flex showcase recently, and it looks like many of the applications are not built with these best practices in mind.

      <description>Jakob Nielsen recently called for an end to password masking, and a few people have come up with interesting approaches that try to find a middle ground between the typical prractice of masking passwords with asterisks. arc90 are experimenting with a half-masking technique. The method partially obscures the password by placing a few blurred characters in the background so that the characters are not easily read by someone looking over the user&amp;rsquo;s shoulder.</description>

The ideal situation is to have a content strategist, perhaps a technical writer, who can provide the guidance for auditing and organizing information, and add some rigor to the writing process. The absence of a content strategist on a project necessitates at least dedicating one person to this task.</description>

Or they&amp;rsquo;re modeled largely after blogs with articles are long and scrolling, are limited by the possibilities of HTML/CSS, and have layouts that aren&amp;rsquo;t differentiated from blogs and which pale in comparison to the layout in the printed version of the original magazine article.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the 6 part collection of minimalist designs posted by Vandelay Design. Some sites are more minimalist than others. I tend to use that term loosely at times as well. But the predominant theme seems to be type as interface, minimal use of graphics (aside from a logo and the body content), few if any graphic treatments of navigation, and little to no use of texture and graphic effects, and liberal use of white space.</description>

      <description>Joshua Porter writes about the use of microcopy to create confidence and alleviate concerns in customers about the actions they take on your site. Ironically, the smallest bits of copy, microcopy, can have the biggest impact. &amp;hellip; Microcopy is small yet powerful copy. It’s fast, light, and deadly. It’s a short sentence, a phrase, a few words. A single word. It’s the small copy that has the biggest impact. Don’t judge it on its size…judge it on its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>Think Vitamin interviews 37 Signals&amp;rsquo; Ryan Singer to talk about ui design, frontend development, project management and inspiration. I like that Singer suggests that designers read more about writing copy, but even more so, I like how he suggests that designers should also consider learning more about front end development and programming frameworks. At the very least, it allows designers to be conversant with developers, and ideally it gives a designer a new range of skills they can use for such things as prototyping or doing proof of concept work on their own.</description>

      <description>Modernizr is a JavaScript library that essentially allows you to use conditionals (if-statements) in your CSS for the availability of CSS3 and HTML5, while still maintaining a fine level of control over older browsers that may not yet support these new technologies.

      <description>Jeff Sexton got Patrick Sullivan, Jr. to list the top things not to do when conducting a usability test. The top 6 list should serve as a good reminder for the UX Designer who does the occasional user test.
1) Never ask, “What do you think about this?”
2) Don’t feed the tester with your question.
3) Don’t let users be the designers.
4) Don’t let the statistics fool you.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with making magnets of some of the elements of the Wireframe Stencil to use for prototyping. Was an interesting experiment printing and cutting these. Next time I think I&amp;rsquo;ll have to laminate the sheet first, and then cut. The lamination might make it possible to write on them with dry erase marker. If you write directly on the magnet sheets the ink will stay permanently I&amp;rsquo;d think. The surface seems kind of porous and a little textured.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading two excellent articles in a dialogue about design with intent&amp;#8212;the practice of strategically designing to influencing user behavior&amp;#8212;and how user centered design process fits or is at oods with the designer&amp;rsquo;s desire to influence. The first is Robert Fabricant&amp;rsquo;s article on &amp;ldquo;Design with Intent: how designers can influence behavior&amp;rdquo;, and the follow up is Dan Lockton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;frog design on Design with Intent&amp;rdquo;.
User centered design focuses primarily on user needs and research and decision making must support these needs.</description>

      <title>Why browser zoom shouldn&#39;t kill flexible layouts</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/why-browser-zoom-shouldnt-kill-flexible-layouts/</guid>
      <description>Zoe Mickley Gillenwater posted an interesting article which makes the argument that browser zoom doesn&amp;rsquo;t obviate the utility of flexible (liquid and elastic) layouts. The argument is apparently being made that because of browser zoom, flexible layouts aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary. But in fact, web designers that have fixed layouts know that the default zoom behavior on fixed layouts causes horizontal scrollbars. The fix is to use &amp;ldquo;Zoom text only&amp;rdquo; options, e.g. in Firefox and Safari 4.</description>

      <description>Core77 reviews Timothy O&amp;rsquo;Donnell&amp;rsquo;s Sketchbook, which looks at the problem solving processes of influential designers on finished projects through the lens of their sketchbooks. It looks beautiful. Organized in three sections, &amp;ldquo;Rough,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Refined,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Random&amp;rdquo; (plus bonus section &amp;ldquo;Revealed,&amp;rdquo; where O&amp;rsquo;Donnell shows the thumbnail sketches he used to lay out the book), almost all sketches/sketchbook pages are pared with pictures of the finished product side by side. The &amp;ldquo;Rough&amp;rdquo; section features loose artwork and thick lines, but crisp final products, like the way Jason Munn turns simple sketches into iconic music posters, while the &amp;ldquo;Refined&amp;rdquo; section sees Stefan Bucher&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous pens turned into, well, equally iconic logos and business cards.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/kicker-studios-jennifer-bove-how-design-enjoyment/</guid>
      <description>Jennifer Bove, principal at Kicker Studio, writes about the ways interaction designers can make design more about people and less about technology--designing behaviors that are defined from the point of view of humans, and designed to elicit emotion, make products and services more enjoyable and easier to use. Bove writes about the subtle things that can reference human connection, whether it is the language presented in system messages, the logic behind system behaviors that reflects human thought and desire, or subtle cues and movement that feels organic This is an excellent read that picks up the thread in Don Norman&#39;s Emotional Design, and Dave Malouf&#39;s recent writing about moving beyond function towards enjoyment.</description>

      <description>Nick Finck&amp;rsquo;s Puget Sound SIGCHI lecture on the Lifecycle of the Wireframe discusses Nick&amp;rsquo;s IA process. My overall strategy for IA is 3 step process; understanding the problem (note: not merely identifying the problem but really understanding it), find a solution (there may be more than one solution, but there is often only one right solution), and present the solution (a large part of your job as a IA is presenting your work so the client can understand the results).</description>

This wording used in an enterprise context is the example provided, &#34;Click here to view your views.&#34; Confusing and awkward. A dialogue follows with several designers, who seem to agree that understanding the language of the business and context, and using that in the given situation is the right approach. It&#39;s a matter of unearthing the terminology, whether through contextual inquiry and exercises like card sorting, and using what&#39;s appropriate and familiar in the context, so users can &#34;</description>

      <description>Occasionally the argument about the affect of aesthetics or beauty on usability seems to come up in UX discussion, and this CHI short paper from 1995 is referred to. This is an article by members of the Design Center, Hitachi discusses the team&#39;s research on determinants to apparent usability, based on tests of design and psychology students. These results show that the apparent usability is less correlated with the inherent usability compared to to the apparent beauty.</description>

      <description>ClickTale makes observations about scrolling based on their research of users&amp;rsquo; browsing behaviors around &amp;ldquo;the fold.&amp;rdquo; Their report on scrolling makes the following conclusions: [I[t appears that visitors scroll in a relative way - about the same percentage of page views will reach the middle of a web page regardless of the actual page height in pixels.
Visitors appear to be using the location of the scroll bar but not the size of the tracker when scrolling, since the scroll bar location is a relative indicator and the scroll tracker size is an indicator of page height.</description>

      <description>Kickstarter is a brilliant idea for creatives needing funding for projects. It&amp;rsquo;s a funding platform for artists, designers, filmmakers, musicians, journalists, inventors, bloggers, etc. It works much like fundraising sites you may have used if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to raise money for events for non profit organizations. A few years ago I used a similar one for Team In Training.
You set up a page stating your mission and the need for funding.</description>

      <description>Design Observer points to the 1999 ABC Nightline program that took an inside look at IDEO. How does the process of designing a better product work? To show you, Nightline went to Palo Alto, CA to the designers at IDEO, and gave them the toughest problem we could think of. Take something old and familiar like the shopping cart and completely redesign it in just five days.
IDEO&amp;rsquo;s unique brand of brainstorming is called &amp;ldquo;Deep Dive,&amp;rdquo; a sort of total immersion into the problem at hand.</description>

You may use them in your UX documents, but the license also permits you to use them in web sites. There are restrictions for use on commercial products or commercial applications that offer products
or services for sale or for fee-based usage, however.</description>

We create concept maps, a type of model, to explore and learn about complex information spaces. By showing everything—the forest and the trees—in a single view, concept maps help people create mental models and clarify thoughts. We create concept maps to share understanding—with our clients, peers, and others interested in the subjects.
 Their gallery of downloadable PDF posters include the creative process, play, innovation, and much more.</description>

As he says, the form itself is the least of your concerns. Porter describes the entire experience leading up to the call to action, providing excellent examples that ease users into sign up.</description>

      <description>Anthony Viviano at Organic asks if Information Architecture is dead, continuing the discussions about the inclusiveness and expanding scope of IA vis-a-vis UX, and hopping on the question about interaction design being a dead end job. Clearly, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t think the practice and craft of IA is dead, just as the craft of Interaction Design is clearly alive. But the role is changing, and while the navel gazing gets resoundingly loud around defining things, the definition of the shifting roles and responsibilities in the field is meaningful.</description>

Rather than sketch the whole page on a sheet of paper, I prefer to draw out the various components of the page, cut them out, and Blu-Tack them to the paper. This makes it easy to change different elements, switch them around, etc, without having to redraw the whole page each time.</description>

The new site describes itself as a a way to find better Windows, Mac, Linux and online applications by submitting the app you want to replace. It&amp;rsquo;s a community site that relies on user submissions, so the number of alternatives is limited in some areas. Having a look at the Basecamp alternatives, for instance, only shows MS Project and the RedMine web app when I looked.</description>

      <description>Jason Santa Maria started a sketchbook group on flickr. Sketchbooks are not about being a good artist, they’re about being a good thinker. In the spirit of awareness, I’ve set up a Flickr group for this very purpose. Post one, and only one, spread/page from your sketchbook. It’s always fun to see how everyone else’s mind works.
 Read more about it in Jason&amp;rsquo;s post Pretty Sketchy.

      <title>Is Interaction Design a dead-end job?</title>

      <description>In the Cooper Journal, Tim McCoy responds to Bill Moggridge&#39;s comment after a screening of Objectified. He paraphrases Moggridge as saying interaction design has become pervasive, that anyone and everyone can be an interaction designer, and so the role of professional interaction designer is (or is becoming) unnecessary.
McCoy asks if interaction design is really dead. He goes on to point out a few factors that have allowed developers to build better interfaces without interaction designers.</description>

 In SVA&amp;rsquo;s Dot Dot Dot lecture series, Jason Santa Maria talks about the role of print design in influencing design on the web, and how visual designers might bring the same level of attention to designing online content with the same rigor and attention to visual meaning.

      <title>12 Excellent Examples of Lazy Registration</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/12-excellent-examples-lazy-registration/</guid>
      <description>This is a short entry about sites that use &amp;ldquo;Lazy Registration,&amp;rdquo; or registration/sign up processes that often don&amp;rsquo;t require any information from the user while they try out a site, until they decide to commit to using it. In some cases, sites bypass signup altogether, and in others, users are permitted to register once they&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go beyond simply &amp;ldquo;testing out&amp;rdquo; a site or application. As noted, the process of &amp;ldquo;getting your feet wet by trying,&amp;rdquo; most likely leads to more sign ups because of the frictionless experience.</description>

      <title>Designing for Faceted Search</title>

      <description>Stephanie Lemieux discusses issues to consider when designing faceted navigation interfaces for search in the latest UIE newsletter.
Faceted search is a very popular and powerful solution when done well; it allows users to deconstruct a large set of results into bite-size pieces and navigate based on what’s important to them. But faceted search by itself is not necessarily going to make your users lives easier. You need to understand your users’ mental models (how they seek information), test your assumptions about how they will interpret your terms and categories and spend time refining your approach.</description>

      <description>I spoke with Russ Perry at the Phoenix Ad Blog to discuss what User Experience Design might mean to graphic designers and marketing professionals, especially those not involved in the design of sites and apps. I don&amp;rsquo;t like getting caught up in the &amp;ldquo;defining the damned thing&amp;rdquo; discussions, but there you have it. Oh, and I mention Zappos, not because of their visual or interface design, per se, but about their relevance in terms of the holistic approach to user experience outside of the interface.</description>

      <description>There are quite a few nice takeaways from Stephen P. Anderson&amp;rsquo;s article in A List Apart, a discussion in defense of the value of visual design beyond more than just aesthetic skinning of functionality. I like this one where he flips the notion that things are enjoyable because of how they function by saying:
[T]hings that are enjoyable will be easy to use and efficient.&amp;rdquo;
 This is connected with the user&amp;rsquo;s belief that attention to design detail is related to quality.</description>

      <description>David Malouf believes that &#34;most successful products create a sense of connectedness between the consumer and the designer and that this connection occurs when designers balance the pull towards the rational, functional, &amp;amp; expedient with the natural &amp;amp; emotional.&#34;
In his article on Johnny Holland, David looks more deeply at what it means for an end-user to be connected to a product. He first looks at how art creates connection with humanity.</description>

      <title>OmniGraffle Tip: Change Keyboard Shortcuts</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-tip-change-keyboard-shortcuts/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip that I blurted out on Twitter in a moment of frustration. I use both Adobe Illustrator and OmniGraffle, and one thing that repeatedly trips me up is using the keyboard shortcuts for grouping/ungrouping between the two apps. Illustrator uses Cmd-G to group, and OmniGraffle uses Shift-Cmd-G. They add the Shift key because CMD-G is assigned to search again which I don&amp;rsquo;t use all that often.
The fix for this, as well as for any Mac application is simple.</description>

      <description>Khoi Vinh wrote an entry on taking the need for criticism inside the studio, and extending that openness in engaging in critical dialogue to discussion with peers outside of your working groups.
Like it or not, you can’t have a serious discourse about an art form until you have people whose sole involvement in that art form is criticism. You need, in effect, an independent press. Actually, to be clear, what you need is an economic model that can support a corps of passionate, clear-thinking individuals who are dedicated to vigilantly watching over the progression of the medium.</description>

      <title>Hunkering: Putting Disorientation into the Design Process</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/hunkering-putting-disorientation-design-process/</guid>
      <description>Jared Spool talks about &#34;visual disorientation,&#34; a designer&#39;s technique for evaluating your design work in the middle of a process. It&#39;s certainly common to see designer&#39;s tack up pieces of paper around their project space, e.g. schematics, pictures with references to other objects that provide inspiration, etc. Hunkering, however, is more of a technique to create disorientation and change in one&#39;s perspective momentarily, to assess what you&#39;ve done. Visual disorientation is a fast way to identify the places where things don&#39;t quite match up.</description>

      <description>UX Hero points out a technique that you may not be using, but should consider. Stepping back and squinting to evaluate your work is something I was told to do repeatedly when I was first learning to paint, and is something I still do today as an interface designer. It helps you see the whole of your screen and look for anything that stands out, and see what needs to draw more attention, depending on the priority and hierarchy of your page elements.</description>

      <description>Twiddla is an easy to use collaborative whiteboard service, but it&amp;rsquo;s really got the potential to be much more. The whiteboard lets you mark up websites and graphics, and even use a drag-drop library of interface elements for working on interface concepts collaboratively. You communicate with others in the meeting with the chat window, and you can also use built in audio-conferencing capabilities. Very impressive, and free. Would make sense for there to be options for private meetings as well as embedding the whiteboard into your CMS or intranet.</description>

I&#39;ve also started including a barebones option without elastic, inner pocket, or pencil. The standard option is $16 and the barebones option is $2 less. The standard option is hand-crafted by me here in Brooklyn, so they&#39;ll sell out faster than the barebones options.</description>

      <description>John M. Carroll discusses the history of Human Computer Interaction on Interaction-Design.org.
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer science. HCI has expanded rapidly and steadily for three decades, attracting professionals from many other disciplines and incorporating diverse concepts and approaches. To a considerable extent, HCI now aggregates a collection of semi-distinct fields of research and practice in human-centered informatics.</description>

      <description>Justinmind Prototyper is a tool to design wireframes and run simulations for web, desktop and mobile applications. The product looks similar to Axure, and lets you define user interface elements using a drag and drop environment with component libraries, and attach actions to components. The prototypes allow you to map interactive behaviors to elements, define process logic and flow, and add functional specifications and annotations. Looks very full featured and offers the possibility of running a web server to deploy multiple prototypes that are viewable in a browser and allow users to comment on designs.</description>

      <description>iPhone Mockup looks like a cool proof of concept for a sketchy mockup app for iPhone. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like Balsamiq in spirit, but is done completely with JQuery. Firefox and Safari are the target browsers, and there is no option for doing secure mockups. Whatever you do will be visible to the world, so don&amp;rsquo;t plan on using it for anything other than playing. Nice concept though. Thanks, Andrew.</description>

      <description>Sideline is an Adobe AIR desktop application built with the Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI) that allows users to create and group custom queries by topics of interest, as well as view topic trends. Very nicely done. Am looking at at how the advanced search works at the moment. Looks very easy to build up an seems like it might be the perfect app for a lurker or follower who doesn&amp;rsquo;t post much.</description>

      <title>Feng-GUI:  Feng Shui for Graphic User Interfaces?</title>

      <description>This is an interesting idea in principle. Feng-GUI helps you find out how people see your website, photo or ad and which areas are getting most of the attention. Feng-GUI simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals,
and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.
This offers designers, advertisers and creatives, a Pre-testing technology that predicts performance of an image, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the Flow of Attention.</description>

After years of making documents that look like they are FEBE (for engineers, by engineers), we’re seeing increasing evidence of the human hand in our own work. Why are sketches and drawing suddenly so prevalent? Well, for one, they can save a lot of time and mitigate the risk of building the wrong thing.</description>

Indeed, when we talk about them, we say they are the cat&amp;rsquo;s meow – which is an American expression meaning AWESOME.
In light of these deeply held beliefs, we created this site to showcase cool experiments for both JavaScript and web browsers.
These experiments were created by designers and programmers from around the world.</description>

      <description>In the latest A List Apart, Airbag Industries&amp;rsquo; Ethan Marcotte writes about designing fluid grids, rather than using the fixed pixel methods provided by most CSS layout frameworks. Marcotte describes that the technique of calculating percentages for column widths is the same method we use for calculating font sizes in ems. To calculate fluid grid dimensions, we first take a base font size of 100%, which is usually 16px in the majority of browsers when not altered by the user.</description>

User experience design is, at its core, a philosophy that products and services should be designed so that they are pleasurable and easy for people to use. While that might seem an obvious design approach, it&amp;rsquo;s actually not the way many designers historically thought about making things.</description>

When I see concepts that are received well, the concept itself can usually only take a portion of the credit. Just as important is how the concept is communicated. Some of this is common knowledge: make it look good, choose the right level of fidelity, show it in context. Others are maybe not so obvious…</description>

It can be confusing to understand the role of the IA, because in many cases, IA encompasses more than what is defined in this primer.</description>

      <description>Theresa Neil is writing a 6 part series of articles on designing great Adobe Flex/Air user experiences. The first 3 parts are up now.
After designing several large enterprise applications for diverse clients and industries, I’ve noticed some barriers to crafting a great experience in Flex. I think these barriers arise from the relative newness of the technology (and RIAs in general), the initial focus on development over design, and the confidence that Flex can provide a great UX out of the box.</description>

But since I can&#39;t give all of you rare swag from Tokyo Toy, I thought I&#39;d offer up a template that freelancers might find useful.</description>

      <title>A to Z Indexes</title>

      <description>uxRefresh has collected a handful of examples of A-Z indexes of titles on large sites. Also useful might be a look at the article I wrote about KWIC/KWOC/A-Z Site Indexes work I did while at Bell Labs, and for a deeper dive, look at the list of links of indexer-designed examples on the Montague Institute&amp;rsquo;s site. Many of the latter are still valid, but there&amp;rsquo;s some link rot there too. James Kalbach also recently wrote on A-Z indexes, and in particular demonstrated the use of indexes in search auto-completion using Elsevier bibliographic database EMBASE.</description>

      <description>The Drawing Board: Commuter Buddy from Cooper Journal on Vimeo. Cooper Interactive&amp;rsquo;s Commuter Buddy concept video is another great find via Dave Malouf&amp;rsquo;s Engage blog. You might have already seen this one, but as Dave points out, it is a great example of using personas, narrative, and really low fidelity sketches to demonstrate a concept.
The video above uses still photography, super-imposed photos of whiteboard drawings, and voice over narrative to describe the idea for a mobile phone application that helps a commuter to get to his ride on time, and even to remember to get off if he becomes engrossed in an article, for instance.</description>

      <description>Thanks to @lorenbaxter&#39;s suggestion, I&#39;ve enabled logging in with email rather than username if you prefer. Luckily Drupal&#39;s logintoboggan module allows admins to offer this option, as well as offering registration and signup without the roundtrip to email. Sweet. Thanks for making my life easier, Drupal.
This should help ease the experience of finding your file downloads as well if you bought stencils or icons form the store. It also brings me around to re-implementing some of the features I put in in Feb-March last year and then took out, e.</description>

      <title>Free Notebook for Konigi Friends at SXSW Wireframe Talk</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve made some 8.5 in. by 5.25 in. graph paper notebooks because I wanted something a little more functional than what I was using for sketching. They&amp;rsquo;re basically a mini version of the wireframe grid I use, with markers for 1/3s and 1/4s, but without the gutters. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a prototype of this for a few months now and have a bunch of these ready to put up for sale, but haven&amp;rsquo;t been rushing to do it, mostly because I made them for myself and selling stuff like notebooks isn&amp;rsquo;t profitable until you get into selling large quantities, and unfortunately I haven&amp;rsquo;t the time to market the pads and books.</description>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/milton-glaser-shepard-fairey-and-plagiarism/</guid>
      <description>Print Magazine interviews Milton Glaser to discuss Shepard Fairey and the topic of appropriation and plagiarism. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, Fairey is the graffiti artist responsible for such iconic imagery as the ubiquitous Andre OBEY tag and the Obama Hope image. Glaser had this to say, on the topic of copying other artists&amp;rsquo; work:
The process of looking back at the past is very accepted in our business—the difference is when you take something without adding anything to the conversation.</description>

      <description>Prezi is an interesting web app that allows users to create Flash-based Zoomable/Pannable presentations. The interface brings up a presentation editor with a keyboard command, and displays a radial menu for placing media objects, drawing paths for prev/next animation, etc. The finished presentation allows users to step through the &amp;ldquo;slides&amp;rdquo; as the canvas zooms and pans. It really might be a nice service for doing things like simple product screencasts, for instance, and hopefully the finished product will allow you to export your work for embedding on your site.</description>

      <description>In &#34;The language we use,&#34; David Malouf discusses how ideas about user interaction can become so ingrained in what we are familiar with, that our language begins to reflect that familiarity. That can lead to a natural tendency to explain away interaction without thought to what it means to the design of a thing. In this case a student describes the change of context in a sketch presentation by using the word &#34;</description>

      <description>Sketches are often better tools for communicating designs than high fidelity illustrations or schematics. The purpose of the sketch style wireframe is to prevent the intended audience from thinking about visual design and focus on the functionality and behavior you are proposing.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of this set of sketch stencils for OmniGraffle, based on the Wireframe Stencil. This set of user interface sketch stencils is designed for OmniGraffle 5.</description>

The point is that users often can&#39;t be bothered with things like figuring out where to put this thing on a file system because we&#39;re too busy with the task at hand, e.</description>

Among my favorite points are those about ownership and involvement. This is to do with ensuring that someone is driving the process and iterations, and making sure that the interaction design process doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen in a vacuum, but is reviewed, validated, and informed by key team members, e.</description>

      <description>In BusinessWeek, Bill Buxton discusses how to keep innovating, with the main idea being that you can continue to cultivate creativity and innovation by finding new things that you have a passion for. He suggests that when you get good enough at a thing, you should find something else to be passionate about, and commit and throw yourself into learning how to do it. You&#39;ll be bad at it at first, but the experience of learning something new, no matter how bad you are at it at first, may affect your creativity in positive ways that you won&#39;t realize until you experience it.</description>

This collapsible breadcrumb was developed to deal with deeply nested, verbosely named pages. Rather than limit the amount of elements shown on the sever side, we decided to go with a client side solution for usability and SEO reasons.</description>

The following is what resulted from our request, comprising in part: a sneak preview of what will be assigned in courses; what some consider to be cornerstone interaction design texts; and what some consider important connections to other fields.</description>

[W]hen someone asks you why you used green, or why you included that crumpled-paper background, or why there’s a bird in the logo, you’re gonna need to know.</description>

      <description>Joshua Porter&#39;s post about whether good design can be replicated is fabulous. What I like is the idea that there isn&#39;t a solid set of methods that you can reuse in every case and think it might guarantee success or &#34;good design&#34;. There&#39;s an interesting thought in there about process:
I wonder if the real issue is that most of the time designers simply don’t know if what they’re building is great, and they end up relying on process to get as far as they can.</description>

      <description>Interesting discussion in M. Jackson Wilkinson&amp;rsquo;s blog about the altnernatives to hierarchical sitemaps, and the use of concept maps or user flows as alternatives when hierarchy doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in your documentation. I have to agree with one point, in that site maps don&amp;rsquo;t always serve documentation well when the notion of a strict hierarchy just doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s utility in sitemaps at conveying the organization of a site or application at some level.</description>

My first requests for sketchy line styles were made to OmniGroup in the Spring of 08 along with a few other users, and I posted this comment to the OG List about this feature. I knew how to do this in Visio, and had read that CAD users have something called a &amp;ldquo;Jitter&amp;rdquo; line style, so I quietly campaigned for this feature.</description>

      <description>Smashing Magazine expound upon what makes a well designed 404 page in their latest design gallery which features 50 examples. Inspired by the gallery, I made a more useful 404 for Konigi as well.

      <description>JazzMutant creates the Lemur and Dexter, multi-touch hardware controllers for audio production, live music and media performance. What I like about this is that it shows how much closer multi-touch brings devices to the experience of using analogous hardware controls like knobs, buttons, and sliders without any physical limitations. I once blog bitched about the fact that the Traktor DJ software I played for a few years limited the fun, and the ability to mix with two hands because at the time you could only use one input device, the mouse, to control the mixer.</description>

      <description>The Printed Blog is an interesting project that aims at publishing a newspaper of weblogs and user generated content. I like the idea of using this as a PDF rather than as a printed newspaper, since I no longer read printed newspapers. I also like the newspaper format, and have been using Tabbloid to peruse my must read daily feeds rather than using my RSS reader lately. I wonder, however, about taking online media and making analog versions of it.</description>

      <description>Peter Morville and Jeffrey Callender have been compiling a list of UX deliverables and have summarized 20 of them succintly on the Semantic Studios site.
This list describes twenty user experience deliverables with links to relevant resources and examples. Clearly, these artifacts of the process are not the whole story. We must also think about the relationship between goals, methods, and documents. And yet, for many of us, deliverables are the coin of the realm and merit special attention.</description>

The demo seems hard coded, but is kind of neat. Would be really weird if they could figure out my gender and favorite colors.

      <description>Fantastic TED video of Paula Scher looking back at her career for those moments where she was able to devote time and effort to serious play and create wonderful work, and contrasting it with the unfortunate moments when the serious becomes solemn. I love how this retrospective observation of her career brings her to conclude that the best of times for her as a designer is when she comes into a project with no grounding or bearing&amp;ndash;those times where lack of history or reference point allows that kind of play to emerge.</description>

In his example he points out the problem with the &amp;ldquo;Repositories: All | Search&amp;rdquo; links in the account box in the upper right of the screen, which suggests that those links are scoped to the user shown in the box. This a great example of how visual grouping and proximity could be more effectively utilized to help users make sense of the available controls.</description>

      <title>10 Most Common Misconceptions About User Experience Design</title>

      <description>Whitney Hess asked some of the most influential and widely respected practitioners in UX what they consider to be the biggest misperceptions of what we do. The result is not only a terrific list that debunks myths, but an excellent compilation of quotes that better describe what UX is about than a clinical definition can. Those who were quoted described UX as many things, from the reach and touch of customers with products and companies, to the processes we use and the roles we play when we take part in its design.</description>

      <description>This is a cool browser-based CSS grid generator created by Rasmus Schultz of mindplay.dk. Lets you quickly set some column, gutter, and margin sizes using forms inputs or button controls. Similarly you can set typography with form controls, and the results are shown on screen. When you&amp;rsquo;re happy, you can bookmark your work, and export the CSS. Sweet.

      <title>Kindle vs. iPhone/iPod Touch: Human/Machine Interaction &amp; User Experience</title>

      <description>Tog&#39;s comparison and analysis of the human computer interaction versus the user experience with both the Amazon Kindle and the iPhone/iPod Touch is excellent. The separation of HCI/UX in his analysis really drives the point home that good interaction and industrial design can make the experience, and a good experience isn&#39;t only about the design.
I don&#39;t use a Kindle daily, so I can&#39;t comment personally on it, but the industrial design was a showstopper for me and kept me from wanting it.</description>

      <description>Faruk Ateş provides some suggestions for implementing pagination, all of which I would agree with. After the suggestion list, Ateş shows quite a few examples and discusses what&#39;s good and bad about them. There&#39;s a huge list of examples on Smashing Magazine as well, although some of them are a little fussy.
Oddly enough, while a few of the examples show the method of using an ellipsis plus the last few page numbers as a way to show number of pages, Ateş doesn&#39;t count that as a recommended practice.</description>

      <description>Will Evans discusses how he uses wireframes in his design process. The story is one you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard before. It&amp;rsquo;s a description of concept design, using wireframes as the tool for finding the right design. One could use sketching just as well. He&amp;rsquo;s talking about that path we take as designers to frame the problem for discussion, extrapolate solutions from that discussion, and generate possible solution concepts. He calls his process one of divergence, transformation, and covergence.</description>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve always found a chore, being a producer of graphic documents, is versioning and organizing the docs for a team. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to use different tools like Source Safe, Sharepoint, Basecamp, and just shared drives to this. One nice thing I like about working with our Traction server is that it does Webdav for document management and file versioning. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on a preview release of to make the web-based interface a bit more friendly.</description>

      <title>Raphael JavaScript Library for Vector Graphics</title>

      <description>Henrik pointed me to Raphaël, a nice JS library for generating interactive charts.
Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. In case you want to create your own specific chart or image crop-n-rotate widget, you can simply achieve it with this library.
Raphaël uses SVG and VML as a base for graphics creation. Because of that every created object is a DOM object so you can attach JavaScript event handlers or modify objects later.</description>

      <title>typeface.js: Rendering text with Javascript, canvas, and VML</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/typefacejs-rendering-text-javascript-canvas-and-vml/</guid>
      <description>I just came across typeface.js, a type face replacement method like SIFR and FLIR, that lets you embed custom fonts in your pages using CSS. On the backend, javscript is used with  or VML to draw the glyphs for your fonts. Compared with SIFR, this suffers from some issues. Biggest one perhaps is that you can&amp;rsquo;t select text since it&amp;rsquo;s rendered as an image. Not so with SIFR. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go using this method for body text, but if you&amp;rsquo;re already considering doing image replacement for elements like headings, this would be a library to watch.</description>

      <description>It seems it&amp;rsquo;s time to start spilling out some of the meta-discussion in my head&amp;ndash;the monologue I guess&amp;ndash;about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here on Konigi. So I started to post announcements and thoughts about what I&amp;rsquo;m working on with a Konigi Twitter account.
Basically, I feel like I want to separate Konigi-specific postings from my regular Twitter stream so I can update interested readers via that account, as well as post more work in progress commentary, observations, and announcements related strictly to Konigi.</description>

      <description>Luke Wroblewski pointed to Josh Bush&amp;rsquo;s Masked Input Plugin for JQuery. Luke writes that the plugin &amp;ldquo;integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for &amp;ldquo;fail-safing&amp;rdquo; that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:
Poka-yoke (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means &amp;ldquo;fail-safing&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Foolproof&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;mistake-proofing&amp;rdquo; — avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation.</description>

      <description>I gave my wife my MacBook to upgrade her from her iBook and got myself a netbook for those times when I&amp;rsquo;m out and need to wait for my son, and for watching Netflix/Hulu/Slingbox in the house. But I&amp;rsquo;m also finding that the netbook, a Lenovo Ideapad S10, is really pretty damned sweet for when I want to head out somewhere and do sketches in a cafe. I use it to post to our Traction server while I&amp;rsquo;m sketching.</description>

James, the team leader had just read Bill Buxton&amp;rsquo;s Sketching the User Experience and wanted to try to get his engineers to rally around the idea that everyone can participate in this ideation phase, and no one needed any specific skill to propose and sketch ideas.</description>

      <description>Peter Flynn gives a demo of wireframing in Adobe Flash Catalyst, aka Thermo. Every online demo I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of this product looks more and more exciting, and this is truly going to give Mac users a way to do easy interactive prototypes as our PC brothers and sisters can do with tools like Axure. I fully expect to be using this thing when it gets out of Preview release. It&amp;rsquo;s only slightly ironic that his first 5 minutes are talk about how wireframes are by definition, low fidelity, given my last post.</description>

      <description>Scribbles is perhaps the simplest drawing program I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried. The app, created by atebits, gives you 4 tools: brush, move, pan, and zoom. There are 12 brush styles, a color picker, a big slider for brush size, and a layer manager. It looks deceptively simple on the surface, but when you explore a bit, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some really interesting functionalities that even the advanced Mac freehand drawing tools like Sketchbook and ArtRage don&amp;rsquo;t do well.</description>

      <description>In Twitter today, I posted a message that I need to resist putting rounded corners on boxes in wireframes. Then I got a few replies essentially saying that stylized elements shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in wireframes. Context is everything. Taken out of context, it is very difficult to possibly critique a specific design technique without knowing the how and why you&amp;rsquo;re using it. Because of that 140 character constraint in Twitter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really explain that this rounded corner example came from my hybrid high-fidelity wireframing and visual design document I was working on.</description>

      <description>At today&amp;rsquo;s excellent Creative Mornings on physical computing, Zach Klein and Casey Pugh from Vimeo talked about tinkering with Arduino, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. They showed some simple circuit controls using the LEDs and Processing, and then demoed a Daft Punk helmet they created with LEDs, that could then be controlled/drawn on via a Flash UI. Neat stuff. Later, I got to talk to Carl, a freelance developer/interaction designer who turned me onto NYC Resistor.</description>

      <description>As many of my friends and colleagues know, I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people that read David Allen&amp;rsquo;s Getting Things Done, got the religion, and tried various methods for planning and managing project tasks, using both software and paper. In the past few years, like many, I&amp;rsquo;ve tweaked my approach, taking bits and pieces from here and there to settle on the solution that&amp;rsquo;s most suitable for the way I work. At this point, any resemblance to GTD might be less noticable, but it&amp;rsquo;s beginnings are there.</description>

      <description>The Brooklyn Museum continues its exploration and extension of Museum services by offering 1stfans a socially-networked museum membership. Members pay a smaller $20 membership fee and get access to special events where they can mingle with other 1stfans members, may skip lines at film events, and get alerts via flickr, facebook, and twitter. The museum also recently added a crowd-sourced art work tagging interface that allows users to describe work in the collection using free tags, and has utilized Flickr for over a year now to promote events.</description>

      <description>Hugh Dubberly has released a free E Book on design and development models.
In this book, I have collected over one-hundred descriptions of design and development processes, from architecture, industrial design, mechanical engineering, quality management, and software development. They range from short mnemonic devices, such as the 4Ds (deﬁne, design, develop, deploy), to elaborate schemes, such as Archer’s 9-phase, 229-step “systematic method for designers.” Some are synonyms for the same process; others represent differing approaches to design.</description>

      <description>The New York Times fashion section article, &amp;ldquo;Blogging at a Snail&amp;rsquo;s Pace&amp;rdquo; discusses slow blogging, a near Ludd-like movement against the practice of posting quick and in high volume. It&amp;rsquo;s like slow food versus fast food. Slow bloggers discard the belief that webloggers need to post often, because the reflectiveness of thought and quality of writing suffer. When comparing the slow versus fast differences, Barbara Ganley, a blogger who writes from Vermont had this to say.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m due for a new version after some cleanup and organization into separate stencils to make use of OG5&amp;rsquo;s nice new stencil panel. The above is the current state of my working stencil in all its ugly glory. Also in my stencil directory are a bunch of pre-fabricated stencils for the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on in the past 2 years at Sling and at Traction.</description>

The key point here is how to use design tools and methodologies to get the right design for the problem. Working through Screens is an online book for product teams creating new or iteratively improved applications for thinking work. Written for use during early, formative conversations, it provides teams with a broad range of considerations for setting the overall direction and priorities for their onscreen tools.</description>

      <description>Andy Polaine&amp;rsquo;s review of books for designers.
Although there are several good design websites that occasionally have book reviews, there didn’t seem to be a single place online where you could get constant updates and reviews of new (and sometimes old) design books.
Design books are often expensive and contrary – sometimes the book is worth having for the physical production values alone, sometimes for the images, sometimes for the words and, occasionally, for all three.</description>

Can&amp;rsquo;t wait until Clip N Sling is available for Sling Box owners and more social features are released. We designed a number of very interesting interfaces which don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be available yet.</description>

At work I wanted to be able to capture things like white boards, projected presentation screens, and do short video of live screens.</description>

      <description>Napkin Look and Feel is a cool looking open source tool for Java developers to produce application prototypes with a low-fidelity sketchy interface.
The idea is to try to develop a look and feel that can be used in Java applications that looks informal and provisional, yet be fully functional for development. Often when people see a GUI mock-up, or a complete GUI without full functionality, they assume that the code behind it is working.</description>

      <description>I very rarely will say anything about a site if the only opinion I have is negative. Twingr looked like an interesting idea. The service let&amp;rsquo;s you create your own Twitter-clone microblogging site, as does Yammer, but without any constraints regarding who you may invite. Alas, I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I know what the experience is like because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the front door, so I walked away possibly never to return.</description>

      <description>Smashing Magazine does a newspaper roundup in a week that saw the FT.com make news for its redesign. These days, the design lines between blogs and newspapers are starting to converge a bit with those newspapers that take the threat of the blog format seriously. Smashing Mag does a good design of screenshooting and comparing what news sites are doing. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/11/11/newspaper-website-design-trends-and-examples/</description>

      <description>ScreenToaster is a pretty incredible web application that lets you record your web browser screen without having to download desktop software. Currently, to record a screen, you open up ScreenToaster in a browser tab, navigate to the page you want to capture, click a keyword combination, and the applet starts recording. Press another key combination to stop. The service saves the session and almost immediately gives you a flash video with your recording.</description>

      <description>Russel Wilson of Dexo Design has done an excellent review of available UI Prototyping tools and provided tables comparing attributes including how fun they are to use, time to ramp up, and support for interactivity. His final assessment is below:
1) Low fidelity mockups for idea exploration and communication: Balsamiq
2) Interactive prototypes to test and communicate interactions: Adobe Flex (Thermo may change my mind)
3) High fidelity drawing tool: Adobe Illustrator or OmniGraffle</description>

If we hope to herald innovation by sharing ideas with a research group , then there’s a boundless value to sharing ideas and thoughts with the world at large.</description>

      <description>Function lists 50 great redesigns in a wide range of industries and product types from logos to automobile design. A redesign can be worth its weight in gold if you get it right. There is a thin line between freshening up your design, and taking a step backwards with a redesign. Sometimes a redesign can be subtle and simple, and other times it can be a huge re-vamp of a company and it’s goals.</description>

      <description>Gazopa provides image upload and drawing interfaces for image search. The idea of finding similar images by comparing against a submitted image or drawing is not new, but search tools that use this tech have failed to catch on in consumer sites. People with information retrieval background might be familiar with IBM&amp;rsquo;s QBIC, query by image content, technology for instance. Gazopa looks very interesting, and the results are not bad at all, even with my crude bicycle drawing above.</description>

      <description>Product Planner is one an brilliant idea. Deconstruct the user flow of web sites, illustrate the flow with annotated screenshot flowcharts, allow users to copy the flow and reuse on the site. Like Konigi, this does a great job of capturing examples of alternative approaches to interaction, showcases them for you to compare, and allows you to select the best examples to learn from and inform you of approaches you may not have thought of.</description>

      <description>Found on smartex, and believed by jibbajabba to occasionally be true of group brainstorming&amp;hellip;
Wikipedia on &amp;ldquo;Brainstorming&amp;rdquo;.
Although brainstorming has become a popular group technique, researchers have generally failed to find evidence of its effectiveness for enhancing either quantity or quality of ideas generated. Because of such problems as distraction, social loafing, evaluation apprehension, and production blocking, brainstorming groups are little more effective than other types of groups, and they are actually less effective than individuals working independently.</description>

      <description>Or maybe we&amp;rsquo;re just comfortable with the mix in of apps and music? No, not me. Artist and Album are certainly just wrong. Don&amp;rsquo;t know how they can make that legacy labeling generic across music/movie/application. Creator instead of artist, perhaps. And just leave album blank for apps and movies. Album doesn&amp;rsquo;t serve a purpose for apps does it? The link doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to work.

      <description>Chris Fahey discusses the merits of bespoke UI design, referencing the successful design of John King&#39;s touch wall which was created for King by Perceptive Pixel. Bespoke design--the practice of designing something specifically for and individual--might be more prevalent in the digital world than most people realize. The examples provided out in the quotes of software designers and developers point out the most common case where this is happening. Designers who design products by focusing on what they want/need for themselves is common enough.</description>

Note: You can switch out &amp;ldquo;IA&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;Design&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Copywriting&amp;rdquo; or whatever it is you like to do!</description>

      <description>Core77 talks about a couple that makes good with self-designed iPod accessory, the iStik. Great example of designers finding buyers in a market saturated with accessory makers. They stand out because they&amp;rsquo;ve thought of the problem, researched how to make the better mousetrap and deliver a product that sells the story of sticking your nano wherever you want when you work out. They&amp;rsquo;ve made $50K in 6 months. Excellent stuff.</description>

      <title>twitrratr: Sentiment on Twitter</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/twitrratr-sentiment-twitter/</guid>
      <description>twitrratr looks like an interesting attempt to provide some sentiment analysis to Twitter. Do a search for a keyword and twitrratr displays the tweets matching that term, with entries organized in 3 columns: negative, neutral, positive. Some algorithm works in the background to determine the sentiment. The major issue I have with sentiment analysis is that it is not trivial stuff. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of vendors who provide this service to corporations doing analysis of product mentions on the web, the effectiveness of this type of analysis is dependent on the algorithms that crunch text, the amount of text, and language used.</description>

      <description>David Pogue offers some suggestions the selection of non-jargony words when writing/speaking about technology. Most of these I agree with. Here&#39;s a few: * Enable. Who on earth says, &#34;Enable the GPS function&#34;? Only user-manual writers and computer-book authors. Say &#34;Turn on GPS&#34; instead.
* Support. I don&#39;t mean &#34;support&#34; as in &#34;tech support,&#34; although even that term is a corporate creepy cop-out (it means &#34;help line&#34;). No, I mean the verb, as in, &#34;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve caught Chuck Todd using a desktop touch interface a few times on MSNBC to click through poll charts. While John King has been using a Perceptive Pixel-designed touch wall, Todd has been using a Microsoft Surface interface on a desktop. The device and manipulation of data on the screen looks very natural on this show, especially for the kind of information he&amp;rsquo;s speaking to. I think whenever there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of visual information to add to a story, this kind of an interface has potential to be very helpful and I look forward to seeing what they do at MSNBC and on other shows.</description>

      <description>Sumopaint, by Snap Group Ltd is looking to be a really slick Flash-based online graphics creation and editing tool. It has a very complete list of functionalities with shapes, brushes, layers, text editing, filters, and many of the features you&amp;rsquo;d expect from Photoshop or (ack) GIMP. Users can share images for community editing, create and view versions, and add comments. This looks like it might turn out to be an excellent resource for those looking at doing things like shared whiteboarding and prototyping without the real-time editing.</description>

      <description>Seems like someone has come up with a better solution for marking my note and sketch pages in my Moleskines. Dog eared pages never suited me, and the colored tabs I get at MUJI and the occasional PostIt note are OK. But I love the idea of these magnetic page markers from Folio because it means I won&amp;rsquo;t need to buy anymore sticky tabs from the stationery store. And the little pointed arrows are pretty useful for pointing out lines of interest in books too.</description>

      <description>Jared Spool writes an excellent article describing how to give a good design critique. A well-done critique is a way to step away from the specifics of the design process and better understand how to create great designs. We do this by starting with the current design and asking &#34;What is it we&#39;re really trying to do here?&#34; and &#34;How close are we to doing it?&#34;
 The design crit is one of the most valuable parts of the design process to me.</description>

      <description>Victor Lombardi discusses concept design in Digital Web Magazine, pointing out that digital designers should take some inspiration from design processes for ideation and concept generation from the fields of architecture and industrial design. I think the main idea is to learn from the practices and methods from these fields, and use that as inspiration for what might be useful in your concept design practice. That is not to say that every project needs to result in a dozen concepts that need to be prototyped at high fidelity and therefore at significant cost.</description>

      <description>In Flow Interactive&amp;rsquo;s blog, Phil Barrett offers advice for those who are considering implementing Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Ribbon in their applications. The Ribbon has received praise from usability folks who see the benefit this offers in terms of ease of use and better, more visible contextual controls. But it has also met with resistance from individuals who find the large menu-heavy approach disruptive.
The ribbon is a decent piece of interface, but like most things in UX, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to design it well.</description>

At home I use the larger Pentels, but when I&amp;rsquo;m out, I carry around the small red Pilot Couleur above attached to my small Moleskine. Ideas often come when I&amp;rsquo;m away from the desk so I feel like I always have to have pencil and paper wherever I go. The Pilots have a rubberized coating, hold 0.5mm leads, and hide an eraser under the push button.</description>

* Expanded 3-D paint, lighting and rendering tools
Illustrator CS4

      <title>NO!SPEC vs. crowdSPRING Debate at 37signals</title>

      <description>37 signals gave the soapbox to crowdSPRING to justify the crowdsourcing and spec work platform and the debate ensued. I got through about half of the long rant, then half of the comments, and called it a day. I&#39;ve already chimed in about my opinion for crowdSPRING. I believe there is a place for this market, and if small businesses will support it with dollars, then it will continue to exist.</description>

      <description>Ars reports on a study by the psychology department at NC State that will appear in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. The study tested how college students respond to fake dialog boxes in browser popup windows and found that the students are so anxious to get the dialog out of the way, they click right through obvious warning signs. Follow-up questions revealed that the students seemed to find any dialog box a distraction from their assigned task; nearly half said that all they cared about was getting rid of these dialogs.</description>

      <description>A Flickr Group with covers from fashion mag, The Face. As an undergrad in the early 90&amp;rsquo;s, I was friends with an art dealer I worked with for a few years who read this magazine. He used to let me borrow his clothes, and the thing I took most of the time was his The Face t-shirt that I&amp;rsquo;d wear with a black jacket. This set of photos brings back funny memories of that NYC gallery scene.</description>

The first round of gear will include wireframe and storyboard notepads. Each of these pads include 50 sheets at 8 1/2 x 11 inches on white 70# paper, glued on the left side. The ink is a non-photo blue (cyan) so that the grid lines and any sketch lines made in non-photo blue pencil can be knocked out when scanned and processed in graphics software.</description>

      <description>CNet reports on Swype, a new keyboard technology for touch screens created by the inventory of the T9 keyboard technology for numeric keypads. Swype lets the user drag their finger across the screen, touching each of the letters in the words they want to enter, and predictive software selects the word they wanted. This could be a great tool to the improve the typing experience on the iPhone, which I find pretty awful compared to a hardware keyboard.</description>

      <description>Ubiquity for Firefox from Aza Raskin on Vimeo. I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed by Aza Raskin&amp;rsquo;s Ubiquity add on for Firefox, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with a lot lately. It completely makes up for the less than exciting experience I had with Enso, which never came close to a Quicksilver experience on Windows. Ubiquity is pretty much the Quicksilver experience brought to your web browser. A smart tool that is summoned by a keyboard shortcut, and provides shortcuts to frequently used tools, and contextually relevant paths to using selected content in the page.</description>

      <description>Ars Technica reports on the 3.1 Alpha of Firefox, which includes support for the HTML 5 Video element which provides some functionality to developers that is not possible with Flash. Video can be interspersed with other web content, playback can be manipulated with JavaScript, and video elements can be directly accessed through the document object model.

      <description>3 recent articles show how to get interactive effects on menus, proving that you don&amp;rsquo;t need Flash for this kind of simple interactivity.  Dave Shea&amp;rsquo;s tutorial in ALA shows how to create interactive menu hover effects using CSS sprites and the JQuery Javascript library. A sprite image is a single graphic with multiple states mapped on the graphic, a technique borrowed from game design, where game characters are shown in different states of action.</description>

      <description>Jakob Nielsen&#39;s Alertbox reports on their study of sitemaps, observing that among the sites they tested, sitemaps continue to be a useful tool to some people. While their study shows that they are rarely used, they can be simple, inexpensive tools to generate for the users who find value in the sense-making cues that a visual overview provides. Their recommendation is to continue to use them if you already produce them, but keep them static and don&#39;t add interactive effects to them.</description>

      <description>Not sure if the user on Vimeo who posted this is THE Woz, but he or she posted this concept user interface for an iPhone menu application that looks very interesting. The video opens with a UI that displays falling media that appear like little square stamps dropping like leaves to a desktop with contacts, photos, videos, etc. on the face of the leaves. The user can apparently pick up one of the pieces, and if it&amp;rsquo;s a video for example, start playing that video in the UI.</description>

In 2007, I began speaking to groups about these simple, cheap, ubiquitous and powerful tools.</description>

      <description>Bill Buxton gives a lecture at the Stanford University Human-Computer Interaction Seminar (CS 547, June 1, 2007) giving an excellent deep dive into some of the topics in his book, Sketching User Experiences.
 Designing for experience comes with a whole new level of complexity. This is especially true in this emerging world of information appliances, reactive environments, and ubiquitous computing, where, along with those of their users, we have to factor in the convoluted behaviors of the products themselves.</description>

      <description>About 10 years ago I participated in the daily indexing of news articles as part of my job designing a digital library. During graduate study for the MLS my concentration was actually on information retrieval and classification, so I was interested in doing the job and understanding the content in order to know how to make it useful to users. Customers would get this information via the web site, by email, and in newsletters.</description>

      <title>Problem Analysis is Not the Key to Successful Design Process</title>

      <description>Diving deeply into problem analysis or early bottom up activity is not typical activity for experienced and successful designers. A more flexible approach and parallel thought processes and activities are more characteristic. That is the observation of Nigel Cross in an essay he writes in the Design Studies Journal.
Victor Lombardi sparks a great debate about design process on Noise Between Stations while discussing the differences in approach to process between expert and novice designers, as described by Nigel Cross and Henrik Gedenryd in their independent research on the topic.</description>

This forward looking concept focuses on 4 high priority elements: context awareness, natural interaction, continuity, and multi-user applications.
Aurora (Part 1) from Adaptive Path on Vimeo. The scenario laid out is one in which one user starts an audio chat and screen sharing sesion with another user and we begin to see how users can find information from their history and share it and remix it with others in the session.</description>

The Hidden Pixels list isn&amp;rsquo;t very descriptive of the specific usage or value each framework has to offer, so I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a summary of each to make this a useful reference when evaluating the list.

(I&amp;rsquo;m kidding. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you will at some point in your life.)
Silverback provides most of the functionality you need for discount usability. People wanting a full featured tool like Morae won&amp;rsquo;t find their solution here, but if all you want is to organize test sessions, capture audio/video of screen interactions and participants face and voice, then Silverback might be for you.</description>

* Personalized width of the page in (em,px,%)
* Use of fixed and fluid columns in the grid.
* Elastic Layout with &amp;ldquo;em&amp;rdquo;s  Blueprint is going to have to catch up and produce a version for fluid layouts.</description>

      <description>I made some color modifications to the graph paper, bumping the cyan of the non-photo lines up slightly. I was noticing that when I print these in grayscale on a black and white laser printer, that the blues were a bit too pale to print clearly. This version works very well when printed. Color printer users will still be able to knock out the blue.

We&amp;rsquo;ll have to see what the reception will be for this. Xbox are integrating Netflix soon, and may be hoping to simplify the experience for a wider audience. I found the Blade UI to be pretty interesting the few times I got to use it.

The framework is being used to drive the new MobileMe service from Apple.
SproutCore is a framework for building applications in JavaScript with remarkably little amounts of code.</description>

      <description>Web Designer Wall has compiled an amazing list of trends in web design for 2008.
So what’s hot now? Pencil sketches, handwritten notes, card stocks, watercolor effects, collage art, script fonts, grungy and splatter ink backgrounds (glossy gradients are not &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; this year). Another trend to be on the lookout for are the vintage and retro styles which I’ve posted earlier this year. Here is a list of 82 sites picked from Best Web Gallery that show the current design trends.</description>

      <description>About This 8.5 x 11 inch graph paper is made for visual designers, interaction designers, and information architects. You&#39;ll find styles for wireframing user interfaces, and story boarding interaction. I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s also used by animators and filmmakers. Enjoy.
 Scanning These cyan and gray grid pages are great for sketching, but also work well when producing high fidelity drawings. The boxes and grid lines of the cyan versions are non-photo blue, so you can easily remove them when scanned.</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time sketching interface ideas on paper. Typically I sketch wireframes and storyboards on graph paper, then redo the final documents in OmniGraffle. But lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using paper for more than just sketching. Now, after spending time sketching ideas and working out design issues, I start to do higher fidelity drawings on paper, scan them, post them to our system. We discuss and iterate, and the process repeats until we&amp;rsquo;re happy, and I spend less time pushing pixels around.</description>

      <description>Gizmodo puts Dieter Rams&amp;rsquo; designs at Braun next to Jonathan Ives&amp;rsquo; designs at Apple.
10 principles of design according to Rams:
 Good design is innovative. Good design makes a product useful. Good design is aesthetic. Good design helps us to understand a product. Good design is unobtrusive. Good design is honest. Good design is durable. Good design is consequent to the last detail. Good design is concerned with the environment.</description>

This is a very simple wiki created on top of Drupal. They&amp;rsquo;ve done a nice job of creating a core set of wiki pages (&amp;ldquo;indices&amp;rdquo;, as they call them) linked off the front so you can edit those pages and create forward links to new resources.</description>

      <description>TechCrunch has some photos of a usability lab used by the Gmail team at Google. Some of the photos include earlier iterations of Google Chat that were being tested in the lab.
I only see shots of the observers&amp;rsquo; room in the photos, but there&amp;rsquo;s some description of their testing room as well.
It’s a small room with a large flat screen monitor, along with a desk and computer. It also has a number of discrete cameras (and a microphone) that keep an eye on the user herself as well as the screen.</description>

      <description>Boxes and Arrows has a very detailed tutorial by Alexa Andrzejewski, interaction designer at Adaptive Path, on creating prototypes in Flash. To tackle the classic “how to prototype rich interactions” problem, I developed a process for translating static screen designs (from wireframes to visual comps) into interactive experiences using Flash. Requiring some fairly basic ActionScript knowledge, these prototypes proved to be a quick yet powerful way to bring interaction designs to life.</description>

The changes affect five major areas of the service: homepage, navigation, profile editor, search and the MySpaceTV Flash player.</description>

      <description>Camspace is pretty slick. The people at CamTrax are demoing the PC camera-based interface. At first blush, I thought it similar to the gimicky Eye Toy games, but this is much better. CamTrax is a software-based technology that enables the tracking of hand-held objects in real time, with high reliability. What you see in the demo is that the software recognizes the hand-held objects and effectively turns them into pointers and other controls that can be used to act on the simple end as a cursor, and on the more sophisticated end as a game controller.</description>

DestroyFlickr explores alternative methods for viewing and sharing Flickr content. Its user interface provides an environment that benefits photos rather than hindering them. With the ability to look at a photo on a dark, neutral background, you can view it without the interference of a brighter surrounding. By using workspaces and canvases, DestroyFlickr is able to retain a constant history of where you have navigated, offering the ability to revisit an area without the need to reload the entire page.</description>

Companies or individuals who are looking to name something pay $99 to request help in naming the thing. Participants provide suggestions and vote or invest a stake in the suggestions that have been posted. Kluster&amp;rsquo;s robots decide which is best, and participants get paid back when they&amp;rsquo;ve invested in the winner. You can find out more about how it works.</description>

The project was inspired by the World Color Survey. The result was the color explorer, aka &amp;ldquo;The Amazing Color Label Wheel!</description>

 Everybody&amp;rsquo;s doin&amp;rsquo; it Small things are often (usually?) more important than big things.
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rdquo; is about the way every individual conducts himself or herself.</description>

Any of these should provide a barebones framework for a small business looking to use WordPress to get their site up and running quickly.</description>

      <description>Laura Richardson writes in interactions magazine, May/June 2008 (subscription required for full text) about a philosophy of industrial design whose goal is to &amp;ldquo;get to the heart of the matter&amp;#8212;meaningful interactions at the core of great product design.&amp;rdquo; In a sense, I can boil this down to needs. People have needs, explicit and unexpressed, that have to be described in relation to your product. The successful products are those where the flow between need and fulfillment are fluid and natural.</description>

      <description>Facebook have announced to developers that they are going to remove the installation requirement screen and allow users to try an application before installing it. What this means is that users won&amp;rsquo;t see the intimidating list of checkboxes to try an application out, and will get to install the application afterwards. This was meant as a preventative measure against spammy methods used by some applications. The developer announcement described the migration to the new requirements.</description>

The event is blogged by Eloy Zuniger, Jr. and covered by Information Week.

      <description>David Travis reports for UserFocus on &#34;ISO 2082, Ease of Operation of Every Day Products.&#34; While web-focussed interaction designers and information architects may not be involved in the design of everyday products, we should probably be interested at a high level, in the processes discussed. As Travis points out, clients are increasingly concerned with objective measurements of usability, and standards such as this &#34;...will help ensure that we have robust and reliable test methods for all interactive designs, whether these are products, software or web sites.</description>

      <description>Here are 2 recent articles that discuss why small teams are more effective than larger ones.  Great Numbers, Not So Great Design, by Khoi Vinh in Subtraction
This craft, and whatever pretensions to art it can pull off, rests so much on the efficiency of transferring ideas from the brain to the hand. This means that in its ideal form, it works best when practiced by a single person. The perfect design staff is a single designer who can conceive of and execute an idea from start to finish — a straight shot from the right brain to the wrist — maintaining the same coherent creative vision throughout.</description>

      <description>Jakob Nielsen&#39;s latest Alertbox recommends that order of OK vs Cancel should be determined by the standard order defined by the platform&#39;s interface guidelines. Alas, if you&#39;re designing for the web, order becomes problematic because Windows interface guidelines put OK first, whereas Apple guidelines put it last. Nielsen suggests that you base the order on the installed platform of your audience, i.e. if you have predominantly Windows users, you might be best served by putting OK on the left.</description>

      <description>Lou Rosenfeld shares the questions one should pose when engaging prospective consulting firms for information architecture and information management project work. This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you&#39;re a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project.</description>

      <description>TextFlow is a new parallel document editing application and service that allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously. The service should appeal to people who use the Track Changes feature of Microsoft Word. TextFlow lets users edit documents, and instantly see the changes suggested. One person can review the changes and apply them. The difference between this service and something like Google Docs or working in a wiki, is that the changes are indicated visually, rather than having to go through the diff displays in revision history.</description>

The iPhone service attempts to maximize the unique features of that device. Listings are simple lists with thumbnails, but if you rotate the phone to landscape orientation, the listings then display alongside a map with markers to show where each place is located. Rotating back returns to the list view.</description>

      <description>The stories of Zappos&#39; commitment to superior customer service has become nearly legendary. From regular upgrades to next day delivery at no cost to the story of a customer service reps delivery of flowers to a customer whos mother passed away. Now, in Harvard Business Online, Bill Taylor tells of Zappos&#39; unusual customer training program. Zappos offers new employees a $1000 offer to quit after a 4 week training session. The idea behind this tactic is that by weeding out people who take the offer, they keep the ones who will be committed to the company.</description>

He points out the failing of choice over context in the old paradigm of UI design. Standardization of UI elements (tabs, combo boxes, etc.) was meant as a way to keep users from having to learn how to use an interface.</description>

This is a great example of how new uses of an application emerge can be defined by users.
Hashtags are a community-driven convention for adding additional context and metadata to your tweets. They&amp;rsquo;re like tags on Flickr, only added inline to your post.</description>

      <description>Noah Brier&amp;rsquo;s celeb tags and brand tags sites is a crowdsourced tagging game that asks participants to tag a brand or celebrity and then see how others have tagged the brand or celeb. The game can be played in reverse as well, by viewing a tag cloud and trying to guess what the brand or celeb is.
I tried to take screenshots, but the celebrities&amp;rsquo; tag results were full of nonsensical tags.</description>

      <description>abduzeedo has a brief interview with Italian illustrator Alessandro Pautasso. Pautasso illustrates his photography by creating ornate, curvilinear, and beautifully decorative overlaying lines. In the interview he talks about his gear and his inspirations, talks about how he got started as an illustrator, and offers a peak into his toolbox. Check it out.

      <description>TwittEarth is another spinning earth globe interface for displaying geolocalized information that&#39;s similar to the Yahoo Newsglobe and wii news channel interfaces. I don&#39;t care much for viewing the public twitter feed, so it&#39;s not very interesting to me. I&#39;m still trying to imagine the context that makes these interfaces practical for everyday use. The place where it makes most sense to me is in the 10 foot experience, as with the wii news channel.</description>

      <title>Zebra Striping: Does it Really Help?</title>

      <guid>http://konigi.com/blog/zebra-striping-does-it-really-help/</guid>
      <description>The conclusions in this A List Apart article about zebra striping, the method of using alternating row colors in tables, strike me as odd. My first reaction to the article was, &amp;ldquo;Why do you need to study the usability of that technique?&amp;rdquo; I wonder if the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t so much a question of usability, but rather of aesthetic sensibility. Bad table row style without zebra striping can adversely affect readability as much as good zebra striping or horizontal rule style.</description>

      <description>Chuck Green offers some advice to designers who see a lot of uniformity in look and feel or sameness of style in their graphic design projects. His point is that design is not artistic expression and that designers need to be able to focus their work on solving problems rather than merely layering their point of view and style over their solution. He argues that the ability to devise different approaches to different problems is difficult, but that designers should attempt this while keeping their opinions at bay.</description>

Some are great for a quick and dirty capture of a page I want to send someone. Others are good for annotating an interface I want to post to a web page. And still others are best for archival screen capture or for interfaces with video. Below are the 6 screenshot utilities that Mac users should know about.</description>

The readbag bookmarking service (it&amp;rsquo;s actually a Google App Engine application) provides the functionality to do one thing very well&amp;ndash;bookmark pages that you want to read for later.
Now you might argue that you can use any social bookmarking service to do this, or something like Evernote.</description>

We&#39;re not building a game for hardcore gamers who will spend 60-plus hours a week here. If you think of those as hour-long dramas on TV, we want to be the half-hour sitcom.</description>

The localization effort is a massive crowdsourcing task that has been both criticized and lauded. The critics often point to the unpredictability and inconsistency of translations. Proponents of the effort applaud the boldness at utilizing an already eager community to contribute to making the application better for users in other non English-speaking countries.</description>

      <description>Bolt|Peters summarizes Bill Buxton&amp;rsquo;s talk at CHI 2008, which is focussed largely around his theory of long nose. The article in BusinessWeek describes the danger of trying to innovate around the long tail theory alone, and attempts to create awareness for this other phenomenon which he calls the long nose. The theory describes how the bulk of innovation is low-amplitude and takes place over a long period of time. [T]he bulk of innovation behind the latest &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo; moment (multi-touch on the iPhone, for example) is also low-amplitude and takes place over a long period—but well before the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; idea has become generally known, much less reached the tipping point.</description>

      <description>The REC movie site is one of the most immersive Flash video interactive pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a long time. The site puts you into the movie as though you are watching video captured from an observer who is actually in the scene. There&amp;rsquo;s a qality to the video and the storytelling here that feels very reminiscent of the Blair Witch Project, and here it is an equally successful vehicle. After exploring and experiencing some of the terror for a few minutes, check out the video footage of audience reactions at a screening of the film.</description>

      <description>Paidcontent reports on a study conducted by MarketingSherpa on advertising bechmarks, which showed the effect of online ad placement in relation to the fold.
According to the report, most individuals don‘t see most ads served to them—especially ads served below the fold. Despite this result, media delivery reports rarely include information on whether, or what percentage of, a media buy was served above or below the fold. On the chart below, the bottom of the blue area represents the percent of total viewers who see an ad; the top represents the percent of total viewers who scroll to a point where the ad is visible on their screen.</description>

Peter Denning and Peter Yaholkovsky break down the tools needed for various knowledge needs into four categories: 1) Information sharing; 2) Coordination; 3) Cooperation; and Collaboration.
 The article apparently discusses the misunderstanding of the term collaboration, and when it is an appropriate practice.</description>

      <description>This is a late 2 month review on the progress developing this blog. In the past couple of weeks, I was finishing off my last days at my job, and I&#39;m now preparing to move on to a new position as Director of UX at a software development company.
February was about getting the site up as quickly as possible and bootstrapping by experimenting with some content creation to fill out the sections.</description>

      <description>I absolutely love the idea The Superest, a game/blog that features drawings of superheroes. The Superest is a continually running game of My Team, Your Team. The rules are simple:
Player 1 draws a character with a power. Player 2 then draws a character whose power cancels the power of that previous character. Repeat.
 To experience the fun in order, start at the first hero.

      <description>On the Geniant blog, T.Scott Stromberg exposes his craft of wireframe sketching. I also spend most of my ideation time sketching. It&#39;s lovely to see other people&#39;s methods for getting ideas down. I love Stromberg&#39;s comments and comic book style.
This might sound kind of pathetic, but seeing the pens and paper he uses is the kind of thing I really geek out on. I love that he&#39;s pimping out the Behance dot grid pads.</description>

      <description>When it comes to researching user&#39;s screen resolution, I&#39;m a strong believer that vertical positioning matters most when considering key issues such as location of identifying elements like site name and h1-type headings, and elements that satisfy business rules such as ad location. The B&amp;amp;A article, &#34;Blasting the Myth of the Fold&#34; addresses this issue well, and I&#39;m in agreement that &#34;the fold&#34; matters little if the above issues are dealt with.</description>

After the last 2 months with this site, I&#39;ve assessed some of the functionality I went out with, and am doing some cleanup. I launched with all the blades out and am now pulling them back in to only expose the essentials.</description>

There are a bunch of things that aren&#39;t working for me on this site that I plan to fix, but I went with the idea of getting things up fast versus getting them out right.</description>

      <description>I updated the OmniGraffle Web Design Template.
This web design template is for people who do wireframes and storyboards. The template was created for OmniGraffle Professional provides the basic layout for a design deliverable including the following master canvases: document title, section title, wireframe (portrait and landscape), storyboard, and blank. The wireframes were created at 950px wide with guides following the Blueprint CSS Grid system. Wireframes also have 2 small hairline marks around the 600px point to mark the approximate fold.</description>

 Useful: focus on people -their lives, their work, their dreams. Fast: every millisecond counts Simple: simplicity is powerful. Engaging: engage beginners and attract experts. Innovative: dare to be innovative. Universal: design for the world. Profitable: plan for today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s business. Beautiful: delight the eye without distracting the mind.</description>

      <description>The Economist reports on some research undertaken by Fang Wu and Bernardo Huberman, a pair of researchers at Hewlett-Packard&amp;rsquo;s laboratory in Palo Alto, California, to compare two strategies used on news sites: one based on the previous popularity of a story, the other on its novelty. The researchers based their study on analysis of articles posted to digg, and the article provides some insight into the digg algorithm and the half-life of an entry (about 69 minutes before an entry gets demoted from the home page).</description>

This, Lopp admitted, causes a huge amount of work and takes an enormous amount of time. But, he added, “it removes all ambiguity.” That might add time up front, but it removes the need to correct mistakes later on.

The templates are simply documents with guides based on the 24 units provided by Blueprint. The background image of the grid is also provided with a layer to show unit numbers if you like, and the Illustrator document shows a fake comp to demonstrate positioning on the grid.

I started out getting as many things up as I could, and am now evaluating the effectivenes of some decisions and simplifying. Some of the issues around changes have to do with figuring out what works best, others are based on issues having to do with services.</description>

      <description>PhoneScoop provides a demonstration and photos of the new Samsung TouchWiz finger touch user interface, a 2.0 version of the company&amp;rsquo;s Croix OS. This one of the first phones to rush to market in order to compete with the iPhone. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be a multi-touch-type interface for two-finger interactions like zooming, but dragging and dropping appears very similar to the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s drag behavior. One of the fun features is a very configurable home page, which provides user-selectable widgets.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve started experimenting with doing video screencasts in the interface section. You can see an example of the first one here: Gawker Media Video Comments. Scroll to the bottom of the screenshots for video--which we&#39;re going to use Vimeo&#39;s excellent video publishing service for the hosting. Here&#39;s a preview of the first video:
Gawker Video Commenting from jibbajabba on Vimeo.  I think it makes a lot of sense to do this for interfaces because screenshots simply cannot reproduce the experience of transitions, motion, and AJAX interactions.</description>

The stories are depicted as red blocks stacked over geographic regions of the globe, with taller stacks indicating more stories. By default the interface will autoplay through the top stories, spinning the globe to get from story to story. Clicking a link to a news article jetisons you out of this otherworldly view of earth, and into text land on a separate page.</description>

The patent discusses interesting ideas for widgets that overlay the screen to allow such display of information as data related to what is on, and interactions such as purchasing tickets to performances, and doing video chat.

      <description>Edward Tufte posted an essay and video with commentary about the iPhone. Tufte is complimentary, for the most part, about the interface being predominantly free of administrative debris, but makes suggestions for how the iPhone can make better use of its screen resolution. As expected, his argument calls for more data density when possible.
He notes that the iPhone has elegantly removed administrative clutter in many places, using the information as the interface.</description>

      <description>CNET reports on Johnny Chung Lee&amp;rsquo;s interaction experiments with the Wii Remote. Lee, a Phd student at Carnegie Melon, does a quick demo of head tracking for VR displays and multi point interaction using the wii remote. His experiments describe with incredible clarity how the wii remote fundamentally works and how the remote might be exploited to do much more than point at single points on the screen and control them.</description>

      <description>Cameron Moll discusses the issue of staring at a blank canvas in Photoshop, and his approach to overcoming &amp;ldquo;blankcanvasphobia&amp;rdquo; and leaping into the design process.
 Familiarize yourself with how others have solved the same problem you’re solving. Draw from previous work. Sketch it out Begin with a grid Begin in grayscale Start with the &amp;ldquo;core.&amp;rdquo; If nothing sticks, come back later</description>

      <description>John S. Rhodes offers a great reminder in this short article on Apogee of how to focus narrowly on singular goals to increase usability. Key things to remember:
 One of the easiest ways to improve usability is by focusing on just one thing. Provide a clear vision. Be practical. Focus for usability.</description>

      <description>Userfocus provides some inspiration for capturing paper prototype tests with Morae and a webcam. Their method invovlves positioning the camera over the prototype, connect the cam directly to the PC, viewing the camera live in a video editor, and recording the output of the editor in Morae. This method is ingenious. It gives you all of the agility of doing a paper prototype, with the flexbility and control of using Morae for the observation, note taking, and highlight reel creation.</description>

      <description>Andy Rutledge exposes the flaws of an established design conventions&amp;#8212;the 3 column layout. The layout is typically identified by a wide center column with 2 flanking narrow sidebar, and it can be found on some of the largest and most popular sites, including Amazon.com and Apple.com. Rutledge points out the limitations and inefficiencies of this layout:
 Symmetry is usually detrimental to content hierarchy Symmetry diminishes viewer interest Having 2 sidebars, one on either side, defeats the purpose of sidebar content It requires that site visitors first learn (and perhaps relearn from page to page) where to look for a particular sort of ancillary information or links Often results in far too much ancillary information on the page The particular sort of visual noise generated by the 2 bracketing sidebars diminishes, rather than enhances, user/reader focus on the main content  Rutledge challenges designers to really think about their given problems and design for them; to challenge what has become conventional.</description>

      <description>The Library of Congress has maded 2 of its collections of historical photographs available on Flickr. The goal is to get users to tag and comment on the photos, as well as help provide identifying information. It&#39;s very interesting to see such a large and old institution embracing open social collaboration like this. When I was in school, the idea of user supplied freetagging was pretty seen as an edge-case activity even for things like private databases.</description>

      <description>The winners of Specialized&#39;s Innovate or Die Pedal-Powered Machine competition have been selected. The Aquaduct Mobile Filtration Vehicle was invented by five students from California: Adam Mac, Brian Mason, John Lai, Paul Silberschatz, and Eleanor Morgan.
 The Aquaduct transports, filters, and stores water for the developing world. A peristaltic pump attached to the pedal crank draws water from a large tank, through a carbon filter, to a smaller clean tank.</description>

      <description>Ben Shneiderman&#39;s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design are user interface design rules described in Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction. Shneiderman proposed this collection of principles that are derived heuristically from experience and applicable in most interactive systems after being properly refined, extended, and interpreted.
To improve the usability of an application it is important to have a well designed interface and these &#34;Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design&#34;</description>

      <title>23 Actionable Lessons from Eye-Tracking Studies</title>

      <description>Christina Laun summarizes the top lessons to take away from eyetracking studies.
 Text attracts attention before graphics. Initial eye movement focuses on the upper left corner of the page. Users initially look at the top left and upper portion of the page before moving down and to the right. Readers ignore banners. Fancy formatting and fonts are ignored. Show numbers as numerals. Type size influences viewing behavior. Users only look at a sub headline if it interests them.</description>

      <description>Usability blogger, John S. Rhodes writes in Apogee that Direct Marketing and UX are the same, or at least share common goals and methodologies. This quote sums up these parallel ways of thinking and working:
There is a serious emphasis on testing and measurement. Metrics are the law. Success is based on tangible results: number of phone calls, number of and type of brochures requested, number of email address captured, number of comments made, number of web page views and so on.</description>
