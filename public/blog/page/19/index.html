On the backend, javscript is used with <canvas> or VML to draw the glyphs for your fonts. </p>
<p>Compared with SIFR, this suffers from some issues. Biggest one perhaps is that you can't select text since it's rendered as an image. Not so with SIFR. I wouldn't go using this method for body text, but if you're already considering doing image replacement for elements like headings, this would be a library to watch. There's bound to be accessibility improvements in the future using methods that put invisible text over the image, or something like that.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://twitter.com/konigi"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt495b9a0894cc6.jpg"/></a></div><p>It seems it's time to start spilling out some of the meta-discussion in my head--the monologue I guess--about what I'm doing here on Konigi. So I started to post announcements and thoughts about what I'm working on with a <a href="http://twitter.com/konigi">Konigi Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel like I want to separate Konigi-specific postings from my regular Twitter stream so I can update interested readers via that account, as well as post more work in progress commentary, observations, and announcements related strictly to Konigi. So if Twitter suits you more than RSS or Email, or if you're interested in my back-channel banter, you can get updates there.</p>
<p>There's also a product page for Konigi now <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Konigi/45954601363">on Facebook</a>.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?756">Luke Wroblewski pointed</a> to Josh Bush's <a href="http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/">Masked Input Plugin</a> for JQuery. Luke writes that the plugin "integrate(s) formatting cues directly into an input field to help signal how to correctly answer a question. These formatting instructions are automatically included in an input and cannot be removed by a user. More importantly, a user cannot enter other non-valid characters into the input field. Check out the demo at Masked Input Plugin."</p>
<p>The video Luke posted to YouTube, and the demo on Bush's site, show how the input mask works. Great example of an elegantly conceived method for error prevention in forms.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/why-fail-safe-when-you-can-poka-yoke/">Why Fail Safe When You Can Poka-yoke?</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Poka-Yoke is a Japanese word for "fail-safing" that I just came across and suspect might be entering my UI vocabulary soon. The entry from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Poka-yoke</strong> (IPA: [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means "fail-safing", "Foolproof" or "mistake-proofing" — avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka)) is a behavior-shaping constraint, or a method of preventing errors by putting limits on how an operation can be performed in order to force the correct completion of the operation. The concept was formalised, and the term adopted, by Shigeo Shingo as part of the Toyota Production System. Originally described as Baka-yoke, but as this means "fool-proofing" (or "idiot proofing") the name was changed to the milder Poka-yoke.</p>
<p>An example includes 3.5" floppy disk. The top-right corner is shaped in a certain way so that the disk cannot be inserted upside-down. In the manufacturing world an example might be that the jig for holding pieces for processing only allows pieces to be held in one orientation, or has switches on the jig to detect whether a hole has been previously cut or not, or it might count the number of spot welds created to ensure that, say, four have been executed by the operator.</p></blockquote>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-image"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3138042543/" title="Cafe Work/Sketch Kit by jibbajabba, on Flickr"><img src="//farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3138042543_c6ea8f8b58.jpg" alt="Cafe Work/Sketch Kit" /></a></div>
<p>I gave my wife my MacBook to upgrade her from her iBook and got myself a netbook for those times when I'm out and need to wait for my son, and for watching Netflix/Hulu/Slingbox in the house. But I'm also finding that the netbook, a <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/notebooks/ideapad/s-series">Lenovo Ideapad S10</a>, is really pretty damned sweet for when I want to head out somewhere and do sketches in a cafe. I use it to post to our Traction server while I'm sketching. I just have to remember to put it aside so I can concentrate on getting the sketches done.</p>
<p>The S10 is small, but it sports a 10 inch screen. The only downside I've experienced so far is that the right shift key is positioned one key to the right, out of the normal positioning. They did this to make room for the directional arrows. I'm a touch typist, so I was afraid this would be a deal breaker. It's been about 4 days since I got it, and I'm quite used to the positioning now. </p>
<p>I spent a lot of time researching the netbook options in the past month and this one was up against the new HP Mini 1000, which got rave reviews, but which has one of those awkward side-positioned trackbpad buttons. After trying the Lenovo at a store, and having great experiences with the solid feel of IBM Ideapads for years as a corporate mucky muck, my decision was easily made. The Lenovo gives me greater hard disk storage options, not like the anemic SSDs. I know the tradeoffs, but I felt the HD options were fast enough. I'm not looking for sexy here, just affordable, light, fast enough, reliable enough (I say enough because it's Windows after all), rugged, and usable. It's got get thrown into a bag when I tool around town and hold up to my abuse.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm really very pleased with it. I's only been 4 days and I've taken it out only once, however, so we'll have to reserve final judgement after a month. It gives me what I need for a limited number of use cases. I won't design on it, but I can do a good deal of reading/writing/media viewing with it. I'm using Google Chrome for web browsing, and for my primary application uses: Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Reader. I'm absolutely loving it, by the way. I can bring my Pentax DS Mobile 600 scanner with me to scan my drawings and upload to our server when I'm out sketching.</p>
<p>That's all for now. If you're interested, you can click the Flickr photo above to see notes for what's inside my kit. Here's the contents:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://alchemygoods.com/haversack.html">Alchemy Goods Haversack</a>, a 6 x 6 x 11 inch shoulder bag made of recycled bicycle inner tubes and a car seat belt. Love this little bag. </p>
<p>2) Notebook cords in a Kensington bag until I can get a strap to wrap them.</p>
<p>3) Glasses in a cheapo case.</p>
<p>4) The Konigi Designer's Notebook prototype, which you should be seeing more of on this site in '09.</p>
<p>5) Konigi wireframe graph paper pad in a vinyl pad holder.</p>
<p>6) Midori Traveler's Notebook with my weekly planner.</p>
<p>7) Lenovo Ideapad S10.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/happy-holidays-from-konigi.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who took some time out of their busy days to read Konigi this year, to provide their feedback and commentary, to download my tools, to buy notepads, and to help me keep a dialogue going with you, my new and old design and development friends. This has been a very rewarding first year playing with this blog, and I feel light years away from those years spent doing iaslash.</p>
<p>I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. I'll be slowing down quite a bit in the next few weeks to spend time with my family, but will return in the next few months with some improvements and surprises on this site. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/software-tool-design-design-sketching/">Software Tool Design: Design by Sketching</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/software-tool-design-design-by-sketching/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/design-by-sketching.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>The <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/software-tool-design-design-by-sketching/">second part of Stephen Chambers' series</a> on designing the ANTS Profiler tool, a .NET code profiler, discusses how a team leader challenged a group to really work collaboratively on developing the concept for the tool's interface by taking away computers and requiring that the team work with only paper, whiteboards, pencils, and markers.</p>
<p>James, the team leader had just read Bill Buxton's <em>Sketching the User Experience</em> and wanted to try to get his engineers to rally around the idea that everyone can participate in this ideation phase, and no one needed any specific skill to propose and sketch ideas. After some initial discomfort, a few people got the ball rolling, and then as the ideas started flowing, constraints and possibilities were clarified, revelations ensued, and useful design directions manifested themselves.</p>
<p>Stephen writes that the 2 main things he took away from the exercise were:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s easy to generate and explore new ideas when everyone is sitting around a table with a pencil and sketchbook to hand.</li>
<li>You don’t have to second guess what someone is thinking. We often just said “Don’t try and tell me – show me.” Two minutes later you had the idea on paper, concrete and unambiguous. </li>
</ol>
<p>This is a wonderful example of how to get everyone (especially engineers!) on your team involved in concrete idea generation. There's no need to fear failure or criticism of ideas because sketches are disposable, but by having the ideas shown rather than just discussed, concepts become inherently clear rather and can be quickly refined or discarded with much less lost time when compared to first doing the work in software. The method used here might be a little extreme--taking all the computers out of the room for the duration of the exercise--but the benefits are clear, given the observations in Stephen's telling of the results.</p>

<p>These javascript plugins work for the Moo Tools or JQuery libraries to provide small in-page layers in a corner or center of the page to do such things as show AJAX alerts for new content updates, e.g. show when new articles posted as iminlikewithyou does, or show changes in page state when someone is editing a wiki page perhaps. </p>

The app, created by atebits, gives you 4 tools: brush, move, pan, and zoom. There are 12 brush styles, a color picker, a big slider for brush size, and a layer manager. </p>
<p>It looks deceptively simple on the surface, but when you explore a bit, you'll find some really interesting functionalities that even the advanced Mac freehand drawing tools like Sketchbook and ArtRage don't do well. One is the tracing paper mode, which gives you a transparent canvas so you can position the window over anything on screen. The other is the infinite canvas, which lets you zoom out infinitely to widen canvas by just dragging a magnifying glass cursor. It's pretty wild, and you kind of get a sense of scale of your zoomed canvas when grids are on.</p>
<p>Seems like kind of a fun toy, but I'm sure you could do a lot more with this if you got creative.</p>

<p>Peter Flynn gives a <a href="http://tv.adobe.com/#vi+f15384v1003">demo of wireframing in Adobe Flash Catalyst</a>, aka Thermo. Every online demo I've seen of this product looks more and more exciting, and this is truly going to give Mac users a way to do easy interactive prototypes as our PC brothers and sisters can do with tools like Axure. I fully expect to be using this thing when it gets out of Preview release. It's only slightly ironic that his first 5 minutes are talk about how wireframes are by definition, low fidelity, given my last post. :)</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/fear-high-fidelity-wireframe/">Fear of the High Fidelity Wireframe</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/fear-hifi-wireframe.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>In Twitter today, I posted a message that I need to resist putting rounded corners on boxes in wireframes. Then I got a few replies essentially saying that stylized elements shouldn't be in wireframes. Context is everything. Taken out of context, it is very difficult to possibly critique a specific design technique without knowing the how and why you're using it. Because of that 140 character constraint in Twitter, I didn't really explain that this rounded corner example came from my hybrid high-fidelity wireframing and visual design document I was working on.</p>
<p>The above is an element in a wireframe. It's for a special kind of tag in Traction, the product I've been working on. They're for todo tags actually, and the element also doubles as a checkbox. If you click the checkbox, the To Do becomes a Done tag. </p>
<p>I'm only posting this entry now so people understand just what the hell I'm talking about in Twitter, and get the bigger picture with regard to what I've been playing at, with going from sketches to UI specs, because very often I skip the rough wireframe stage these days, and go right to design comp-quality elements in UI specs. </p>
<p>I wireframe fast. Faster than I work in Illustrator or Photoshop. I also do all of our XHTML/CSS. But it's still a hell of a lot faster for me to illustrate something in OmniGraffle. That's its purpose after all--it's a drawing program. It's for illustrating. Maybe it's static and it doesn't illustrate everything well, but when I need interactivity, then I do it some other way. But there are times when I find it does a hell of a job at illustrating visual design too.</p>
<p>My point is that there is a place for doing high fidelity in wireframes. The outie/innie distinction is good to point out here. In my situation, HiFi serves a purpose because I'm the one who goes from pencil sketch to implementation just short of hooking up the back end system functionality and AJAX. There are parts we do that go from sketch to implementation, or from discussion to implementation. But there are definitely parts where I do a HiFi wireframe because it's a more efficient path. 99% of the time, I'm not specifying/presenting to communicate an idea to a customer/client, I'm creating to both test out an idea with a design/dev team and to prep the way for graphic production on a visual design that's already been approved.</p>
<p>This discussion may seem out of left field, but it's something I do pretty regularly actually--go from Lo Fi at the onset of a project, to doing Hi Fi when visual design is there. So what's your take. Do you have a similar experience or treat wireframes differently than the majority of IA/IXD pros out there?</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/creativemornings-arduino.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>At today's excellent <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/weblog/2008/11/creativemorni-1.html">Creative Mornings</a> on physical computing, <a href="http://10minchat.com/">Zach Klein and Casey Pugh from Vimeo</a> talked about tinkering with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, an open-source electronics prototyping platform. They showed some simple circuit controls using the LEDs and Processing, and then demoed a Daft Punk helmet they created with LEDs, that could then be controlled/drawn on via a Flash UI. Neat stuff.  </p>
<p>Later, I got to talk to Carl, a freelance developer/interaction designer who turned me onto <a href="http://www.nycresistor.com/">NYC Resistor</a>. NYC Resistor is a hacker collective with a shared space located in downtown Brooklyn where people meet regularly to share knowledge, and hack on projects together.</p>
<p>As a maker, I've been really interested in doing more to combine my craft hobbies with my techie and interface design interests. Resistor sounds like the kind of place I'd be able to do that, and I agree that more web people should play around in this area. Reminds me of some of the 1990's fusion of art/tech in NYC, ala adaweb, JODI, and Eyebeam.</p>
<p>Resistor sounds pretty cool. I've been looking for a reason to play with Processing, and looks like some Processing workshops are going on at the space. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/finding-productivity-method-fits/">Finding the Productivity Method That Fits</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/printable-ceo-task-timer.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>As many of my friends and colleagues know, I'm one of those people that read David Allen's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a></em>, got the religion, and tried various methods for planning and managing project tasks, using both software and paper. In the past few years, like many, I've tweaked my approach, taking bits and pieces from here and there to settle on the solution that's most suitable for the way I work. At this point, any resemblance to GTD might be less noticable, but it's beginnings are there. </p>
<p>The methods and tools that work best for me now are influenced by <em>GTD</em>, Niel Fiore's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/0874775043">The Now Habit</a></em>, and from a broader perspective, by ideas inspired by Napoleon Hill's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich">Think and Grow Rich</a></em>, which seems now to me to be less about planning your road to wealth, and more about how to use thought to visualize goals. Out of those kinds of ideas, stem the more practical suggestions of taking the larger goals and breaking them down into smaller tasks, a la the book <em><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-Do-You-Eat-An-Elephant?&amp;id=945215">How Do You Eat An Elephant: One bite at a time</a></em>, which seemed to be recommended reading years ago to grad students.</p>
<p>In any case, the sum of everything I've taken from those books that I deem doable for me without being unreasonable. I do some of these with regularity, e.g. the high level planning, and others more loosely, e.g. the daily task list.</p>
<p><strong>High and Mid Level Planning</strong></p>
<p>This is the outline for a high level plan for a single project. Apply for each project, and iteratively apply to sub-projects. Revisit and revise based on changed goals in the daily/monthly/quarterly view. It's kind of a like a roadmap and is done at the above intervals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set high level goals per project and record them. This can be done for both work and personal projects.</li>
<li>Break the high level down into steps towards achieving that goal, and further break those down into smaller and smaller bits that can each be accomplished in one sitting. Each step should be ideally accomplishable in a specific time frame, e.g. up to 1 hour on 15 minute intervals with repeat attempts as necessary.</li>
<li>Review the steps in the process, and record each step as a task or to do.</li>
<li>Plot groups of tasks along a high level continuum, e.g. year, quarter, month</li>
<li>I may also create a sort of radar and plot the projects on a 2x2 grid with a Y vector for importance/priority and an X vector for level of effort.</li>
<li>Put your tasks in project folders (phsyical folders or in software like OmniFocus, Things, an Outliner, Word, etc.), and put in order when possible so that next actions are at the top.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Low Level Planning</strong></p>
<p>This is the day to day work of getting things done. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your project folders for next actions and list all the goals that need to be done today. GTD peeps call these tickle folders, and the practice is to check these frequently to see where you are.</li>
<li>If anything is waiting for feedback or input from someone else, file it back in or defer it, but check in with people you're waiting on if you have to.</li>
<li>With your list of goals for the day, mark estimated time to complete or level of effort.</li>
<li>Start going down the list based on priority and level of effort and list tasks that you know you can complete for the day. Create a task list based on those "can do" actions, with estimated times to complete and checkboxes.</li>
<li>Record tasks completed and time to complete.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, plan your goals for the next day.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ongoing Review</strong></p>
<p>This is the ongoing planning I do every quarter and every month to set goals, and assess where I am with regard to the last month.</p>
<ul>
<li>As above, adjust the higher levels according to shifted actual goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a hell of a lot of stuff, and I haven't even included the idea of planning the things you want to do, a la Now Habit and Uncalendar. I don't do all of these. I do some of the above on paper in my sketchbook. At the top, I place my date and goals radar. Below, I list my tasks with checkboxes, level of effort/duration, and actual completion duration. I've actually been playing around with a task book based on this, which I print and bind myself.</p>
<p>Recently I've also been turned on to some great ideas that validate the above approach and give me ideas for how to better support this obsession with finding the method the works for me. One is <a href="http://www.jackcheng.com/time-on-your-side">Jack Cheng's idea for forward time tagging/estimation</a> in your task list. And the other is David Seah's <a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo/">Printable CEO</a> work sheets for tracking actual effort, and a <a href="http://davidseah.com/tools/ett/alpha/">Emergent Time Tracker Flash app</a> he's developing to do time tracking, which is pictured above. I've been playing with it, and it's really quite nice. I'd be interested in using something like that full time on my Mac and iPhone. The Behance Network's <a href="http://www.actionmethod.com/">Action Method</a> is a nice web-based service that let's you do all of this online.</p>
<p>Anyway, now seemed like a good time to start sharing my thoughts on what works for me, mainly because I'm interested in hearing what works for other people. For now, I'm sticking to a combination of OmniFocus for the longer term planning and paper for the daily planning/tracking and it's working for me. It's been amazing to see how much people like to talk about this topic, but since Merlin's stopped talking about GTD on 43 Folders, maybe we'll stop talking so much about getting things done, and just get them done. Which reminds me, this blog entry has eaten up more than 30 minutes now.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>&quot;I don't want to develop a relationship with these guys. I just want to buy something.&quot; That's what some of your customers are saying when you ask them to register or sign in, and some of them will walk away with their dollars if you frustrate them enough. UIE rounds up the most common mistakes they observe from watching users in testing sessions try to sign in to user accounts.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are many great business advantages to having users create an account and log into the system. You know who is using your system, how often they visit, and what they do on the site. You can store information they might need later, such as their order history and their billing info for future purchases. And, you can offer them content and services reserved for only your best clientele.</p>
<p>Yet, in usability test after usability test, we see the registration and sign-in processes to be consistently problematic. It's the most common thing that scares users away from shopping on e-commerce sites. It generates the most calls to the customer-support call center</p></blockquote>
<p>Here's the list of mistakes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Having a Sign-in In The First Place</li>
<li>Requiring Sign-in Too Soon</li>
<li>Not Stating the Benefits to Registering</li>
<li>Hiding the Sign-In Button</li>
<li>Not Making &quot;Create New Account&quot; or &quot;Forgot Your Password&quot; a Button or Link</li>
<li>Not Providing Sign-in Opportunities at Key Locations</li>
<li>Asking for Too Much Information When Registering</li>
<li>Not Telling Users How You'll Use Their Information</li>
</ol>

Members pay a smaller $20 membership fee and get access to special events where they can mingle with other 1stfans members, may skip lines at film events, and get alerts via flickr, facebook, and twitter. </p>
<p>The museum also recently added a crowd-sourced art work tagging interface that allows users to describe work in the collection using free tags, and has utilized Flickr for over a year now to promote events. </p>

<blockquote><p>In this book, I have collected over one-hundred descriptions of design and development processes, from architecture, industrial design, mechanical engineering, quality management, and software development. They range from short mnemonic devices, such as the 4Ds (deﬁne, design, develop, deploy), to elaborate schemes, such as Archer’s 9-phase, 229-step “systematic method for designers.” Some are synonyms for the same process; others represent differing approaches to design.</p></blockquote>
