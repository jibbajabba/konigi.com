<p>Zeus Jones has a great <a href="http://www.zeusjones.com/blog/2009/conversational-ux-design/">write up about using conversational language</a> and cues to invite users through interactions. The deconstruction of the lazy trial/registration process in Tumblr is used to demonstrate how this type of engagement makes the learning process natural and inviting. The discussion picks up on the Cluetrain meme of markets as conversations, positing that systems are conversations, and turning front ends into actors that use conversational language as interface. Afterall, if software is to be social, then it may as well learn social skills.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/design/top-10-ux-myths/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a95c2b02ba2f.jpg"/></a></div><p>Keith Lang, co-founder of plasq.com, wrote a fantastic article for Think Vitamin <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/design/top-10-ux-myths/">about UX Myths</a>. It&rsquo;s full of references and examples debunking stuff we hear repeated enough times that they begin to go unquestioned.</p>
<p>The top 10 UX myth list:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Design Has to be Original</li>
<li>People Read</li>
<li>People Know What They Like</li>
<li>Design Always with Implementation in Mind</li>
<li>Can’t Decide? Make it a Preference</li>
<li>If you Have Great Search, You Don’t Need Great Information Architecture</li>
<li>UX Design Stops at the Edges of the Product</li>
<li>Design to Avoid Clicks</li>
<li>People Don’t Change</li>
<li>If the Design is a Good One, You Don’t Need to Test It</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these become so ingrained, that it takes a lot of effort to convince clients or colleagues otherwise. I&rsquo;ve struggled with many of these beliefs, holdig on to some of the earlier in my career, e.g. I remember heated debates about and broad versus deep and the number of click to get to destinations. I struggle with #2 people read, and #5 preferences and handling options. Those can be huge challenges when you&rsquo;re looking for ways to simplify existing software.</p>
<p>There are so many nuggets here to be appreciated, and a few observations in UIs that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of. Check it out. If any of the references are new, you&rsquo;ll be surfing off the links for days.</p></p>

I particularly like the method he&rsquo;s come up with for displaying headings to show the proportion of content for each section relative to the whole.

You start by entering your site url, and selecting regions of your page design to be used in the mobile template, using their online template editor. For many sites, one template may be sufficient to serve all of your page types. After selecting regions, you may change their order in preview mode, as well as add custom HTML and modify CSS. Custom domains are supported, and with an upgrade, you may remove the Mobify branding and receive web analytics. You can use it with a plugin for your CMS, or by simply inserting Javascript into your site, which redirects to the mobile version.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried several mobile services in the past. This one is perhaps the easiest I&rsquo;ve had the experience of setting up. The initial setup time was maybe 15 minutes, plus the time to wait for the CNAME to update on my webhost. You can try Konigi mobile at <a href="http://m.konigi.com/">m.konigi.com</a>, or view konigi.com on a mobile device.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/magazine/2009/08/the-iphone-is-not-easy-to-use-a-peek-into-the-future-of-experience-design/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a8b1adb1092d.jpg"/></a></div><p>Fred Beecher wrote the excellent article &ldquo;<a href="http://johnnyholland.org/magazine/2009/08/the-iphone-is-not-easy-to-use-a-peek-into-the-future-of-experience-design/">The iPhone is Not Easy to Use: A New Direction for User Experience</a>&rdquo; on Johnny Holland to talk about why the iPhone is <strong>not</strong> easy to use (at first), and why it changes the game for user experience designers. The examples illustrate how gestural interfaces are hidden, and lack the affordances of physical buttons. But the real story here is how the iPhone brings one thing to the experience that is more important than usability&#8212;fun.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a user experience designer, I thought my job was to make things not suck. Until recently. As technology has evolved, human behavior has evolved along with it. Since behavior is the basis of user experience design, my job has evolved as well. Now, my job is to make things people love. At the 2009 IA Summit, Karl Fast articulated the value proposition of user experience design with sparkling clarity. “Engineers make things,” he said, “we make people love them.” And then he held up an iPhone as an example.</p>
<p>This is a crucial change, the importance of which cannot be overstated.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool to me that creating pleasurable and fun experiences has become such a meme because the issue of usability has become less important when compared with the feel of the product. It&rsquo;s always there in terms of principles, but I personally never want to lean on it as a crutch when designing. I think we sometimes equate usability with sterility and boredom. This is an odd thing to see myself write, since I&rsquo;ve spent so much of my time trying to design usable things, or make things other people create more usable. </p>
<p>I think the point about finding fun and exploiting the users&rsquo; willingness to play are key. Having an 8 year old son that is really into games of every type (card, board, video, and schoolyard games) has helped me gain a different perspective on interface design. It&rsquo;s not just in terms of seeing his immediate adaptability to the iPhone without the burden of reference to older interfaces. Most kids from pre-literacy learn to push and pull buttons and screens right away until something happens. But what I&rsquo;ve been experiencing is how a child&rsquo;s curiosity, continual exploration and willingness to absorb information and fail quicker to get to desired goals is such a positive thing in terms of the learning experience. </p>
<p>One thing that has also immersed me in all of this fun learning is that we homeschool our son here in NYC. I&rsquo;ve used gaming a great deal as a part of the learning experience with my son. I went through a period years ago when he was very young where I read <em>Got Game</em> and <em>Everything Bad is Good for You</em>. Our son talked us into getting him a GameBoy Advance so he could play with an older child, and my wife and I thought, &ldquo;Why not make it part of his learning experience?&rdquo; And we&rsquo;ve been doing that with whatever he becomes interested in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that Fred mentions the game Fluxx. We&rsquo;ve been playing this game all summer, and I bought blank cards to make our own rules. To my son, games aren&rsquo;t just about accomplishing goals and earning stuff, they&rsquo;re also largely about becoming an actor in the story and taking that experience to think of new games he wants to create. Fluxx is a great example of a game that lets users become more active participants in the rules. </p>
<p>MMPORG games immerse the gamer in a world where the player is part actor. SIM games like Spore bring God-like power to gamers. Games with creation mode like Little Big Planet allow users to re-cast the rules and experience. All of these create a different kind of user mentality that will be more interested in not only exploring the hidden, pleasurable world of easter egg interfaces, but who will also want to do more, explore more, and view computers as social and recreational tools as much if not more than tools to get things done. And that opens up the range of elements and methods you can use in interfaces.  </p>
<p>These are great challenges. On my last large project I spent a lot of time working on game interfaces to push creation of user generated content within a video watching community. A few years after leaving, I see that none of that experimental work got to see the light of day. But I found the experience of thinking about how playfulness and even play within the application could make the use more pleasurable and as a designer it was incredibly exciting. I&rsquo;ve jumped into a totally different world&#8212;enterprise software&#8212;where the challenge to make the experience pleasurable is even greater, and the implementation of these types of UIs more subtle. </p>
<p>I think what I take away from Fred&rsquo;s article is that we can&rsquo;t overlook the value of play, and I would add that empathy for the different experience of the younger generations who value things and possibly approach using things differently than we might. For more on this topic, read Fred Beecher&rsquo;s <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/magazine/2009/08/the-iphone-is-not-easy-to-use-a-peek-into-the-future-of-experience-design/">article in Johnny Holland</a>.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Fred Beecher wrote what he thinks are the nine essential characteristics you must possess to make a good software user experience designer, in reaction to a comment made about skills an IA should possess. It's an excellent read for those listing qualifications and evaluating UX Designers for hire, and a great list of qualities for job-seekers to demonstrate during interviews.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Deep Understanding of Human Psychology &amp; Research Methods</li>
<li>Competence in the Basics of Graphic Design</li>
<li>An Awareness of and Interest in Technology</li>
<li>Verbal &amp; Visual Communication Skills</li>
<li>Moderate Familiarity with Business, Deep Familiarity with Your Business</li>
<li>The Ability to Quickly Learn a Subject Matter Area</li>
<li>Mediation, Facilitation, &amp; Translation Skills</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Vision</li>
<li>Passion</li>
</ol>
<p>Elizabeth Buie also added a familiarity with HCI literature, and undboubtedly with HCI history, which I think should be there as well.

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/realizations-rounded-rectangles/">Realizations of Rounded Rectangles</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.uiandus.com/2009/07/27/theories/realizations-of-rounded-rectangles/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a76fe347eb48.jpg"/></a></div><p>Plasq designer, Keith Lang, recounts the story from computer folklore of <a href="http://www.uiandus.com/2009/07/27/theories/realizations-of-rounded-rectangles/">how the rounded rectangle came to dominate</a> the Mac OS, and discusses its effect on visual cognition. He gets Professor Jürg Nänni, author of <em><a href="http://www.blelb.com/english/blelbpub/publications_en.htm">Visual Perception</a></em> to offer his opinion.</p>
<blockquote><p>A rectangle with sharp edges takes indeed a little bit more cognitive visible effort than for example an ellipse of the same size. Our “fovea-eye” is even faster in recording a circle. Edges involve additional neuronal image tools. The process is therefore slowed down.”</p>
<p>Professor Nänni is saying that rounded rectangles are literally easier on the eye. Put another way, compared to square-edged rectangles, rounded rectangles are more computationally efficient for the human brain. To me, this is a revelation. An idea that at the very least demands more investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comment by Voideka provides a perfect visual reading of the difference between the rounded and sharp angled shapes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&rdquo;&hellip;to me the difference I perceive is a single line versus four lines. In other words, when corners are involved, the brain processes from point A to B, then B to C, and so on, until it completes a circuit. With rounded corners, the line never comes to a point, which we interpret as a stop, and so there is a single computation following the entire shape.</p>
<p>I think the key is in thinking of a point as a full stop (much like a period in a sentence).</p></blockquote>
<p>The point being made is that a particular use of shape, color, position, and movement are not simply aesthetic decisions, but can impact visual cognition. Mullet Sano&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0133033899">Designing Visual Interfaces</a></em> is another good source for the kinds of principles that can be used in practice. I haven&rsquo;t read Nänni&rsquo;s book, but have read a lot of literature on visual literacy, and tend to like the argument, however subtle, about the impact of the rounded shape on effort and perception.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/so-youre-thinking-about-becoming-designer/">So you&#39;re thinking about becoming a designer?</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Liz Danzico sought out the advice of digital designers and designer conspirers to ask them to respond to the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>So you’re thinking about becoming a designer? If I could tell you only one thing about going into the field, my advice would be ___________ .</p></blockquote>
<p>The suggestions ranged from the philosophical to the pragmatic. Below are the ones that resounded with me. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Focus on empathy and understanding problems</h2>
<blockquote class="martop1"><p>
Being empathetic helps designers create things that move people.<br />
- Jennifer Bove</p>
<p>Don't just fall in love with a solution and go full force and making it look great, but really make sure that whatever you design is filling a need in the world and has a purpose.<br />
- Whitney Hess
</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to design, I'm a big believer in empathy, as are most IA/IXD's who invest in user research. Jennifer Bove's video focusses on this. Whitney Hess also hits on a similar point.</p>
<div class="video">
<object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802242&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802242&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></div>
<p>When it comes to finding solutions for people, I'm also a fan of JM Spool's "don't do anything stupid, don't do anything clever," although it's more about finding the middle ground between clever and stupid.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Embrace the unfamiliar to innovate</h2>
<blockquote class="martop1"><p>Be a champion of effortful study, the act of constantly tackling problems and challenges that lie at the very edge of your ability.<br />
- Ryan Sims</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm also a big fan of taking on new work that is unfamiliar in order to be <a href="tags/innovation.html">innovative</a> and improve one's skills. I love what Bill Buxton and Paula  Scher have to say on this topic. Ryan Sims, also states it rather succinctly and points out that there will be dues to pay if you want the experience and wisdom.</p>
<div class="video">
<object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802338&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802338&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object></div>
<hr />
<h2>Be passionate</h2>
<blockquote class="martop1"><p>Have undying, unending passion for what it is you're doing. You'll run up against people who don't understand, who don't want to pay for it, who don't respect it. Ultimately none of that matters if you have the passion to make that happen.<br />
- John Kolko</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, I think the thing that I agree with most, whether it has to do with design or knitting or whatever you do, is that you have to be passionate. </p>
<div class="video">
<object width="400" height="307"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802291&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5802291&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="307"></embed></object></div>
<p>If you don't believe that passion is important, or that you can't get you far without <em>talent</em>, I suggest watching <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878134/">A Man Named Pearl</a></em>, the documentary about a self-taught topiary artist who, prompted by a bigoted comment,  proves to everyone around him that hard work and passion are what matter.</p>

This is a rare, in-depth look at the prototyping process for an interface that we come into contact regularly.</p>
<p>The agency was contracted to abandon the prior touch screen/solid state UI, and transform the software to work with touch screen interfaces only and improve flow and visual design. There&rsquo;s some discussion of research considerations (environment, check scanning concerns), and excellent description of the design choices for button design, layout, and behavior, including the smart shortcut feature, which acts as a history-based shortcuts area for frequently-used features, and a deep look at the check deposit flow. I also appreciated the description of the physical factors of ATM screens and environments that affected contrast and positioning of controls.</p></p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/captchas-effect-conversion-rates/">CAPTCHAs&#39; Effect on Conversion Rates</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/captchas-affect-on-conversion-rates"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a69ae19728e9.jpg"/></a></div><p>SEOmoz user chenry posted some i8nteresting data showing captcha&rsquo;s effect on conversion rates vs. reduction in spam. Chenry was given the task of eliminating spam that was being submitted through a web form. Disliking the captcha solution, he decided run a test to compare the data after adding captcha for a period of time, with data captured after turning captcha off. He made the following observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the data you can see that with CAPTCHA on, there was an 88% reduction in SPAM but there were 159 failed conversions.  Those failed conversions could be SPAM, but they could also be people who couldn’t figure out the CAPTCHA and finally just gave up.  With CAPTCHA’s on, SPAM and failed conversions accounted for 7.3% of all the conversions for the 3 month period.  With CAPTCHA’s off, SPAM conversions accounted for 4.1% of all the conversions for the 3 month period.  That possibly means when CAPTCHA’s are on, the company could lose out on 3.2% of all their conversions!  </p></blockquote>
<p>The important data point seemed to be this: &ldquo;159 total failed conversions while the CAPTCHA was on&rdquo;. There were no failed conversions when captcha was off, but they also got the spam. Interesting observation, and a number that&rsquo;s pretty significant if we&rsquo;re talking missed sales or signups I suppose.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/stopping-spammers/">Stopping Spammers</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Well, it's been a hell of a morning. As you know, Konigi allows registered users to post to the blog, showcase, tools, and wiki sections. Up to now, all user submissions have been appropriate, but last night a registered user posted spam content to the blog. This is largely because I missed one configuration option--spam checking on blog/notebook entries.</p>
<p>That user has been banned/blocked, but for the time being I'm adding a few measures in place to prevent this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>All submitted content, whether node or comment, is being passed through both Akismet and Mollom spam modules.</li>
<li>All submitted node content (i.e. posts rather than comments) is being moderated, and held from being published until reviewed. This means any blog, showcase, and tools entries won't go into published views immediately.</li>
<li>Posts will no longer make it to Twitter via TwitterFeed. That was just a poor and lazy choice to begin with. I won't use the service anymore.</li>
</ol>
<p>I apologize for the spam entries that made it into the site and onto Konigi's twitter stream, and thank you for enduring the past few hours. It was my fault for missing one of the checkboxes when configuring my Mollom module and setting user submissions to publish &amp; promote to front page.</p>
<p>In the 7 or so years that I've maintained multi-user blogs, it's been increasingly challenging to keep spammers out. This time it was really user error and the software was not to blame. I'm really vigilant about this stuff, and had I been awake, would have put the above measures in place sooner. </p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10287132-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">CNet reports</a> on an MTV Networks survey on the effectiveness of their video advertising formats. </p>
<blockquote><p>"Project Inform," the MTV survey, found that a five-second-long "pre-roll" ad in advance of the clip, combined with ten seconds of a semi-transparent ad unit that takes up the lower third of the video (and starts about ten seconds in), makes up "both the most effective and the most audience-friendly ad product for short-form online video," according to a release.<br />
MTVN calls this the "lower one-third product suite." It was tested against two other ad packages, the "sideloader," which combines the five-second pre-roll with an ad that rolls out of the side of the video window; and a traditional 30-second pre-roll before the ad.</p>
<p>So, obviously, that's a limited number of options and certainly doesn't reflect the full range of possibilities for online ads. But it was thorough: Project Inform ran consumer survey tests across about 50 million video streams on the Web properties for media brands like MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon.</p></blockquote>
<p>There's also mention of Hulu's success last year of providing users the option of viewing longer pre-video ads rather than interrupting their video. You can read the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10287132-93.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20">MTV article here</a>.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://dustincurtis.com/you_should_follow_me_on_twitter.html"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a5f3892ded25.jpg"/></a></div><p>Dustin Curtis did an interesting <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/you_should_follow_me_on_twitter.html">experiment with a short call to action</a> at the bottom of his pages, asking users to follow him on Twitter. Comparing the results shows that direct, but informally worded calls to action, and (ugh) using a literal call out like the word &ldquo;here&rdquo; had a pretty significant impact. </p>
<blockquote><p>As the forcefulness and personal identifiability of the phrase increased, the number of clicks likewise increased. &ldquo;You&rdquo; identifies the reader directly, &ldquo;should&rdquo; implies an obligation, and &ldquo;follow me on twitter&rdquo; is a direct command. Moving the link to a literal callout &ldquo;here&rdquo; provides a clear location for clicking. I tried other permutations that dulled the command, used the word &ldquo;please&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;should&rdquo; and made the whole sentence a link. None of them performed as well as the final sentence.</p>
<p>At the very least, the data show that users seem to have less control over their actions than they might think, and that web designers and developers have huge leeway for using language to nudge users through an experience. </p></blockquote>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/halfmask.php"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/halfmask.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Jakob Nielsen recently <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/passwords.html">called for an end to</a> password masking, and a few people have come up with interesting approaches that try to find a middle ground between the typical prractice of masking passwords with asterisks. </p>
<p>arc90 are <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/halfmask.php">experimenting with a half-masking technique</a>. The method partially obscures the password by placing a few blurred characters in the background so that the characters are not easily read by someone looking over the user&rsquo;s shoulder. This seems like an interesting idea. The problem for me is that I can&rsquo;t say that the characters are easily read by me either. Can you make out the password in the screenshot above? It&rsquo;s hard to, I would argue. But, I&rsquo;m one of those people who has trouble with the more twisted captchas or those with too much background noise. My eyesight is not bad, mind you, I just interpret some of the characters more creatively I guess. </p>
<p>Another interesting idea uses a behavior that is typical in mobile phones, which masks the typed character after it is displayed briefly in the input for a specified time, or after the user enters a subsequent character. This is a terrific behavior in phones because the character is completely visible to the user. I guess it could argued that it could still be read over the user&rsquo;s shoulder, however. You can try that solution in the <a href="http://blog.decaf.de/2009/07/iphone-like-password-fields-using-jquery/">iPhone-like passwords using jquery</a> post on the Decaf blog.</p>
<p>Both are interesting solutions to a problem that might be a minor nuisance to some users (although I would argue that captcha is a much bigger one to me). But my opinion is that simply having a toggle to hide/show the password clearly might be an even simpler approach. For users in public places, the input might be masked, but when they&rsquo;re alone they can keep it in the clear.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Chris Dary also pointed to his <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/2009/07/hashmask.php">HashMask</a> experiment at arc90, which we discuss below.</p></p>

<p>The ideal situation is to have a content strategist, perhaps a technical writer, who can provide the guidance for auditing and organizing information, and add some rigor to the writing process. The absence of a content strategist on a project necessitates at least dedicating one person to this task. Kissane&rsquo;s article shows how to use content templates to provide the framework for preparing each page of content so they may communicate the essential information effectively and consistently. If you have an IA on the project, this can follow from wireframes on new work.</p></p>
