  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/multi-touch-system-i-have-known-and-loved/">Multi-Touch System I have Known and Loved</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Bill Buxton's "<a href="http://billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html">Multi-Touch System I have Known and Loved</a>" has been updated as of Sept. 2009. The article provides examples and a history of the multi touch systems Buxton has been involved with or known about over the years. </p>
<blockquote><p>Multi-touch technologies have a long history.  To put it in perspective, my group at the University of Toronto was working on multi-touchin 1984 (Lee, Buxton &amp; Smith, 1985), the same year that the first Macintosh computer was released, and we were not the first.  Furthermore, during the development of the iPhone, Apple was very much aware of the history of multi-touch, dating at least back to 1982, and the use of the pinch gesture, dating back to 1983.  This is clearly demonstrated by the bibliography of the PhD thesis of Wayne Westerman, co-founder of FingerWorks, a company that Apple acquired early in 2005, and now an Apple employee.</p>
<p>In making this statement about their awareness of past work, I am not criticizing Westerman, the iPhone, or Apple.  It is simply good practice and good scholarship to know the literature and do one's homework when embarking on a new product.  What I am pointing out, however, is that "new" technologies - like multi-touch - do not grow out of a vacuum.  While marketing tends to like the "great invention" story, real innovation rarely works that way.  In short, the evolution of multi-touch is a text-book example of what I call "the long-nose of innovation.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>PhotoSketch is an online tool created by five students from Tsinghua University in China and the National University of Singapore. It creates storyboards from sketches by finding &amp; stitching background images &amp; item layers.</p>
<blockquote><p>We present a system that composes a realistic picture from a simple freehand sketch annotated with text labels. The composed picture is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement<br />
with the sketch and text labels; these are found by searching the Internet. Although online image search generates many inappropriate results, our system is able to automatically select suitable photographs to generate a high quality composition, using a filtering scheme to exclude undesirable images. We also provide a novel image blending algorithm to allow seamless image composition. Each blending result is given a numeric score, allowing us to find an optimal combination of discovered images. Experimental results<br />
show the method is very successful; we also evaluate our system using the results from two user studies.</p></blockquote>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bregman/2009/10/i-lost-18-pounds-in.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4acce97265132_1.jpg"/></a></div><p>Peter Bregman writes about how <a href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/bregman/2009/10/i-lost-18-pounds-in.html">finding the simplest solution provides the most effective path to change</a>. In his story he talks about how changing one thing, one habit or pattern of behavior, permitted him to be effective at losing weight. This simple strategy contrasts with the multitude of diet books that suggest entire regimine of change in order to lose weight.</p>
<p>It's a great tale that Bregman uses to illustrate how simplifying a process or dealing with a challenge can sometimes be most effectively handled by reducing it to its essence, and devoting 100% of energy on a singular action. I think there's no doubt that this practice, whether it's in finding a touch point for a strategy or determining a singular idea behind a project's goal is pretty powerful. </p>
<p>I can see this kind of focus working well for me if I remember to keep the one thing in mind. I'm finding the idea compelling enough that I tacked it on my wall to remind me of the focus of my current project.</p>

<blockquote><p>Audi A4 Car Configurator by Neue Digitale / Razorfish in collaboration with Realtime Technology AG. Showcased at this year’s IAA - the world’s leading automotive fair. The application allows multiple users to configure an Audi A4 simultaneously by changing the car's paint finishes, rims and by selecting and coloring style package components. The configured A4 is experienced in an immersive 3d environment, in which users can navigate seamlessly by zooming and panning using a multitouch-enabled interface</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm becoming more and more intrigued by the latest offering of inexpensive touch screen PCs like the <a href="http://us.msi.com/msiaio/specs/productslist.aspx?id=1">MSI Wind Top</a> that have been released recently, as well as the rumored Apple Tablet. I'm excited for the penetration of touch interfaces on higher resolution desktop applications, which will start to spread at a much greater rate to a wider audience when we see low cost devices like tablets and touch screen desktops at netbook prices. </p>
<p>The researchers behind BumpTop released a new commercial version of their desktop interface software that shows how Windows users might begin to use their touch screen PCs before Microsoft releases its own touch interface. You may recall the demo of BumpTop for Windows tablets that was initially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWe-TIy2Lbs">demonstrated in 2006</a> and published in Proceedings of CHI 2006. The recently released $29 product for Windows 7 is a desktop overlay that allows users to access, manipulate and filter objects on their desktop using a <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=143055">piles metaphor</a>.</p>
<p>If Apple comes out with a tablet, I'm sure will see a lot of similar interfaces using their dock piles. Watch the video above to see how the app transforms the Windows desktop, or check out the <a href="http://bumptop.com/">BumpTop</a> page for more info. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/caterina-fake-why-working-hard-overrated/">Caterina Fake on why working hard is overrated</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/001196.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4ac372308eb1f.jpg"/></a></div><p>Caterina Fake, founder of Flickr and Hunch, <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/001196.html">talks about why working hard isn't as important as working on the right things</a>. Or as I once heard on a cartoon as a kid... "you have to work smarter not harder."</p>
<blockquote><p>Much more important than working hard is knowing how to find the right thing to work on. Paying attention to what is going on in the world. Seeing patterns. Seeing things as they are rather than how you want them to be. Being able to read what people want. Putting yourself in the right place where information is flowing freely and interesting new juxtapositions can be seen. But you can save yourself a lot of time by working on the right thing. Working hard, even, if that's what you like to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved that paragraph. I also loved the anecdote about Watson and Crick, the scientists who discovered the structure of DNA, and how their discoveries didn't come from hard work, as much as from being in the world thinking, experiencing, allowing ideas to happen. I think there's a valuable nugget in there to product developers about that space that's sometimes needed for creativity that isn't valued enough and understood. </p>
<p>Creating features to compete, building, and accretion without the relentlessness to say no and focus on the right things isn't the path to quality and excellence. The right path in product development is kind of like finding the right path in life. Asking the hard questions about the things that matter and prioritizing effort around those things <em>is</em> hard work. But it's not working hard on the wrong problems, for the sake of working or existing. It's defining what is meaningful and pursuing those thing with fervor. </p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2009/09/23/spoolcast-prototyping-experiences/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4ac36b004fcd8_0.jpg"/></a></div><p><a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2009/09/23/spoolcast-prototyping-experiences/">Jared Spool talks with Todd Zaki Warfel</a> about his forthcoming <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/">Prototyping</a> book to be published by Rosenfeld Media, and got him to talk about his 2 years of research while working on the book.</p>
<p>Todd's firm, Message First, utilizes prototypes as a core element of the design process and has been giving a series of presentations and workshops recently to describe his research into the different prototyping practices of UX pros, and talk about the utility of the prototype. He engages clients early on in generating ideas, and uses the prototype to quickly get something in front of them that comes as close to the experience and behavior they might expect from their product. He provided a little bit of insight into their process.</p>
<blockquote><p>It may surprise you that they start with rough, black and white sketches which they share with their clients both early and often. Whereas some design shops may work hard on a prototype for three months before first showing it to their client, Todd thinks that’s a bad idea. There’s nothing worse than diving deep into a design direction only to have it unilaterally shot down in the first review.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to get your client to give you lots of feedback very early in the process, starting with basic and rough sketches. It will save both sides a lot of time, effort and frustration. Once the design direction is solidified, Todd and his team move their prototypes into color and interactivity. The Messagefirst crew is now often jumping straight to HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the higher fidelity mockups.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the things I took away from this talk was that the best prototyping tool is the one that your most familiar with and know how to exploit to communicate the ideas. That said, there comes a point where the tool you use, whether it's Visio or OmniGraffle, Powerpoint or Excel, shows its limitations at communicating well enough. And this is why so many people jump more quickly to HTML prototypes.</p>
<p>This is essentially where I am today. I'm strong enough in the tools I use and have extended them beyond the capabilities they were created for. But what Todd and his team are doing makes sense. He engages clients early on with sketching exercises, and continues to ideate and refine on paper until they have a strong direction, and then they begin to demonstrate the ideas in a format that feels like the product.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-maeda/technology-design-apple_b_291748.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4abcd995ce216.jpg"/></a></div><p>John Maeda wrote a short article for Huffington Post about simplicity and humanizing design, what it has meant for the software developed on Apple products, and what it means for the future. </p>
<p>The respect so many designers have for Apple is possibly bourne out of reverence for the philosophies that lead to reduction, simplicity, and the humanizing of user interfaces. Maeda talks about Jonathan Ive in this regard, citing his ability to make something real and human by getting his hands dirty. These people, he says, are the ones who will drive creativity and innovation in what they do. </p>
<p>Maeda's take on the future of design seems to be that the national emphasis on left-brain thinking alone will not be enough to drive economic development. </p>

<p>The paper prototype is generally used as a design tool and even usability testing tool, but the folks at IG Index have figured out a creative way to use sketches and paper prototypes as a communication tool in place of wireframes for demonstrating interaction to development teams. Martin Belam posted video from UX London 09 of Jane Austin, Chris Neale and Frances Eida discussing this simple method of taking wireframe/storyboard sketches or paper prototypes, and creating stop-motion animation to demonstrate interface. Wonderful stuff. <a href="http://www.currybet.net/cbet_blog/2009/09/uxlondon_redux_jane_austin_chris_neale.php">More at Currybet</a>.</p>

<p>It divides the stream into 2 panels: private information on top (messages, calendar events) and public information on bottom (stock quotes, news). It provides color-coded category markers, and a draggable menubar that allows the user to selectively change the volume of information between top and bottom lists, and when pushed to a single end, provides focus on that category. A multi-click toggle on the right icon of the menu bar allows you to filter by shuffling through categories. </p>
<p>Nice use of direct manipulation to set volume and filter the feed. To get the full demonstration, <a href="http://larvalabs.com/product_pages/intelligent_home_screen.html">click the video link on the product page</a>.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://userexperience.evantageconsulting.com/2009/09/playfulness-usability-context-delightful-user-experience/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4ab7c8d1441ca.jpg"/></a></div><p>Fred Beecher did an informal usability test of 2 conversion apps for the iPhone--Convert and Covertbot--and wrote up a thought provoking review regarding the relationship between playfulness and usability. Convertbot could be viewed as the more playful and whimsical of the 2 apps. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fun isn’t always the new usable. There are situations in which usability is more important than playfulness and those in which it’s the other way around. The delight that playfulness contributes to an experience depends on the context surrounding that experience. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>[W]hile playfulness is undoubtedly an important new focus in user experience design, it’s not a panacea. User experience designers need to understand when playfulness is more effective than pure usability in inspiring delight and vice versa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fred observed that playfulness wasn't always favored, but that "playfulness is more effective at certain levels of interaction and when there is a clear benefit to the user to learn the mechanics of that playfulness." </p>
<p>With regard to the use case of converting measurements, his small sample favored the less playful interface that required less to learn. Clearly the dimensions of frequency of use, and specificity of the use case are big factors. The quick information need when converting a measurement is nothing like exploring other kinds of information-rich environments. But the exception in his test points out that once she learned how to use the playful app, she preferred it better. What I'm wondering is, how do you determine when playful comes at too large a cost? What is the point where the burden of learning is outweighed by the benefit of use?</p>
<p>He's suggesting that ultimately UX designers need to understand the balance between playfulness and usability, and the goal is to deliver appropriate experiences that achieve sustainability while making users enjoy using the product. Again, I think audience, context, and use case seem to be key factors. <a href="http://userexperience.evantageconsulting.com/2009/09/playfulness-usability-context-delightful-user-experience/">Read the full article for more</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/usabilla-beta-continues-improve/">Usabilla Beta Continues to Improve</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://usabilla.com/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a9ffafacb35a_0.jpg"/></a></div><p>I've been watching <a href="http://usabilla.com/">Usabilla</a> for some time now as a beta tester with the expectation of utilizing it on several projects. They've continued to make improvements to the app, with the help of our feedback. They've also posted new information on their site to familiarize users with their product. This is a review of my recent test with the latest revisions.</p>
<h2>Creating Tests</h2>
<p>The process is still quite simple: 1) Create a new test, 2) Add pages to test either from images you upload or using URLs, 3) Use the pre-defined tasks and add your own tasks, 4) Invite users to participate.</p>
<div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/usabilla-1.png" /></div>
<h2>Test Session</h2>
<p>I was initially drawn to Usabilla for it's 5 second test capabilities, but also wanted to the ability to do more with some screens, e.g. ask users to answer questions in addition to simply showing where they'd click to do something. They provide this with the "add note" function.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a test session, the app acquaints users with the controls they'll be using. The difference between points and notes is the one thing that I think could use more clarity. Even making the screen above call out, "This is a point" and "This is a note" more explicitly could serve as a sort of mini-tutorial to short-circuit any confusion and familiarize users even more before they start. I just wonder how much people actually read these things because when I started using Usabilla, it took me a few seconds to realize that I had to switch tools to use the annotation tool. It's very simple and straightforward once you get it, but I feel you have to be reminded that it's there. </p>
<div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/usabilla-2.png" /></div>
<p>I also thought that I might want a task to require users to answer a question with their click mark, so I wondered if it might be possible to provide only the annotation tool for some tasks. Or perhaps, the point tool could be accompanied with the annotation function? I'm not sure what would work best given all of the use cases, and would be careful of changes because what it does now is simple.  </p>
<h3>This is what it looks like to add points when completing a task/answering a question.</h3>
<div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/usabilla-3.png" /></div>
<h3>This is what it looks like when adding notes.</h3>
<div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/usabilla-4.png" /></div>
<p>Usabilla does the simple stuff very well. The click to answer / point system works for me, and might be the best you can do with an unguided usability test. The annotation control has improved as well, and I think people who don't want to add notes will simply use the point control. But in my test session, there were a lot of responses made using annotations, so I find it more than adequate enough for most needs and a pretty elegant solution, given that these tests run on autopilot.</p>
<p>There are a lot of features being asked for in their GetSatisfaction page. Hopefully there's room for some of the features that are being asked about, e.g. can we test user flows by linking screens together or using linkage between live pages? I think these are great ideas, and if they figure out how to pull it off, it would be exciting to try. </p>
<p>I'd also be interested in some sort of light post-test survey functionality. That may be out of scope for Usabilla, but they provide a nice work-around in that the redirect URL at the end can be pointed to a survey. </p>
<p>The menubar shown in the test is another area that I hope will continue to improve, perhaps as a smaller, fixed bar. Again, the beauty of this tool is that it does a simple thing very well--gets feedback on screens using questions you ask. Asking for too much will mean harder work staying effective for that primary use case.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>After the test is complete, You can view results using the Analyze section. The pages tested are shown as thumbnails. Selecting a page displays tasks and allows you to select colors to display the click-point markers overlaid on your screen. Markers can be shown as points, clusters, and using heatmaps. Hovering over notes displays the note content.</p>
<div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/tools/external/usabilla-5.png" /></div>
<p>I've provided some feedback suggesting improvements to the flow from Test tab to Analyze tab. Some minor things just need to be cleaned up to improve these interfaces for me, e.g. Analyze links from Test pages should go directly to the right page, Analysis page should use progressive disclosure, etc. Data from the results can also be exported as text.</p>
<p>Usabilla continues to improve with each version. They're listening to feedback and responding to feature requests. The promise of doing remote usability testing with a tool like Usabilla is not that it will replace formal usability testing. But it fills a gap by providing a service to those who want to do many small tests, e.g. 5 second test, or who only want a few questions answered. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/whats-broken-about-wireframes-and-how-can-we-fix-them/">What&#39;s broken about wireframes and how can we fix them?</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <p class="dek">Generally speaking I have 2 gripes with wireframes. One is that they're very limited and come with issues in terms of communicating design. Secondly, they're not fast and flexible enough as communication artifacts.</p>
<p>HTML wireframes and prototypes provide some relief from some of the issues, and I'd like to hear what other people are looking for when doing HTML wireframes in order to fix and overcome the limitations of wireframes made in graphics software. </p>
<p>First, here is my gripe list. And for clarity, I use OmniGraffle primarily to create wireframes now.</p>
<h2>Limitations for communicating design</h2>
<p><strong>1) People have to learn to read low fidelity schematics</strong></p>
<p>You end up with clumsy disclaimers about design, people focus on their rough aesthetics rather than on functionality, etc.  This is why so many people find sketch-style artifacts useful. The "unfinished" quality allows people to get past the surface qualities because the final product obviously won't look like that.</p>
<p><strong>2) People sometimes expect them to demonstrate final visual design</strong></p>
<p>This is the other end of the fidelity spectrum. People just have a hard time with both gray box diagrams and with detailed wireframes. Some repeated education and introduction to the wireframe is needed to summarize the purpose it serves.</p>
<h2>Limitations when producing wireframes</h2>
<p><strong>1) Components are not reusable as updatable instances</strong></p>
<p>Some applications allow you to use stencils and external files imported into a document. But they don't have the behavior of instances, as Flash does, where updating the master object updates instances. You can fake this in some tools, and other tools provide real libraries, e.g. Fireworks. Flex's UI Component Library may come closest to what I'm looking for--library items that can be instantiated and properties customized. The extension of this is to allow the component to be saved and extended so it can be re-used, i.e. a private library.</p>
<p><strong>2) Common behaviors have to be represented multiple times--CRUD, design pattern</strong></p>
<p>A lot of these behaviors can be represented in a design pattern library perhaps. What I've done in the past is to create storyboards for common behaviors across a document, so that their behaviors need only be represented once. Something like this is useful if it can be used with the local library ideas mentioned above. Create a local library of components and they only need to be designed once. Insert where needed in the prototype and the behavior is identical. A separate document can be created to demonstrate all of these and perhaps organize them for developers to view.</p>
<p><strong>3) Some people expect them to be updated constantly, which is hard given the re-use issues</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to both make these easier to update globally and to make small changes. Issues related to this include version control and rolling back changes. This also would be an issue for library components. Documents and libraries can be backed up for brute force versioning, but use of version control systems would be ideal.</p>
<p><strong>4) They're time consuming and therefore costly to make, as opposed to sketching.</strong>  </p>
<p>I'm still not sure if HTML wireframes will come with time savings, but I am hopeful that their ability to demonstrate ideas more clearly and effectively wipes out those costs by allowing shorter iterations.</p>
<h2>What are your gripes?</h2>
<p>Do you have any other ideas about what needs to be fixed about wireframes? This is an effort at a "Pony" brainstorming meeting (as in "I want a pony!") to see what other people want to solve with html wireframes that graphic wireframes fail at.</p>

<p class="dek">Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies on TED: freedom of choice. In Schwartz's estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The idea that more choice leads to paralysis rather than happiness resonates strongly with me. I think about where I am in terms of my spiritual and psychological development, and I do feel dissatisfied when things aren't perfect today and I find it troublesome that I think this way. But I do remember where choices of some things were limited, although that period may have been very short. </p>
<p>As a Westerner, I think the number of choices put in front of me for any particular consumer item has been overwhelmingly many. Schwartz says this abundance causes many of us to have difficulty making decisions. We become paralyzed. And even when we're able to overcome the paralysis, we end up feeling less satisfied. The more options there are, the easier it is to regret choice.</p>
<p>I think this is terribly sad, but it is a reality we deal with as interface designers as well. As someone who is working on an incredibly complex piece of software&#8212;so complex that I struggle to understand some of the more powerful, yet obscure features&#8212;the challenge is enormous. If people experience this flood of choice and paralysis in their everyday experience, you can damn well be sure that they're not going to tolerate it when they have to use your software to get their job done. Or maybe they'll tolerate it and be pissed off all the time about it. So you'd better work extra hard not to piss them off.</p>
<p>I think this comes down to making decisions for people. If you have to have the obscure, less utilized feature, the challenge is to find a way to enable its use without creating a cognitive cost in what you present for the primary use cases. We utilize progressive disclosure for some of these things. It's hard work making decisions to make things less prominent or to cut features. </p>
<p>I think about this great screenshot of the Zune from Giles Colborne's "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/secrets-of-simplicity">Secrets of Simplicity</a>" presentation. When the Zune removed features it got better reviews. That may only be perceived improvement, but it most likely also reflects better decision making around what's necessary rather than about keeping ahead of pace with the market in terms of growing features, something that Microsoft software is notorious for.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/zune-simplicity.jpg" style="max-width:310px !important;" /></div>
<p>But that's the job we have to do as UX designers arguing on behalf of the silent user. I think of this like being the lawyer representing a body of plaintiffs that's suffered damaged due to neglect. Some software companies can defend the position that they've made decisions based on what they thought people wanted (more choice) and get away with that. The other aspect of choice is that people can also decide to stop patronizing you and buying your software. The smart companies take notice, become accountable, and invest in making things right even if its at a cost in the short term.</p>
<p>This the mentality we have to take, and the arguments we have to make when looking at the glut of decisions we present users with. We need to be accountable to those who pay us to use our products. The flip side of choice is this. More is not always better. Less is not exactly more. Best is providing the right options at the right time. </p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=143248897792"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a96a9b2715c3.jpg"/></a></div><p>It's not terribly newsworthy, but Facebook's design team announced that they've stopped rounding corners on all elements. I noticed, however, that they kept the slight (3px?) rounding of names in the To: field of the messaging section. That somehow feels like a natural place for an exception to rounding corners for some reason. You know, so you don't get impaled when backspacing in the field. Kidding. This is a quote from their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=143248897792&amp;comments">announcement</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since we introduced rounded corners to Facebook, their consistent use has been spotty at best. The corner radii vary, and it sometimes feels arbitrary which corners are rounded and which are not. Additionally, they add an extra layer of complexity to the code (note: IE, please add support for border-radius).</p>
<p>As part of the effort to simplify our visual style, the design team recently decided to go back to our square corner roots. In doing so, we hope to champion cleanliness and the razor cut look that Facebook is known for.</p></blockquote>
<p>See. It's a "razor cut" look. Pardon me while I roll my eyes loudly. Design-wise, it does have the boxy Facebook feeling of the original, without the muddy bluish gray backgrounds in the sidebars. It's never been known for being beautiful, but I like that they're being decisive about their identity and settling on a consistent style.</p>

<p>Zeus Jones has a great <a href="http://www.zeusjones.com/blog/2009/conversational-ux-design/">write up about using conversational language</a> and cues to invite users through interactions. The deconstruction of the lazy trial/registration process in Tumblr is used to demonstrate how this type of engagement makes the learning process natural and inviting. The discussion picks up on the Cluetrain meme of markets as conversations, positing that systems are conversations, and turning front ends into actors that use conversational language as interface.
