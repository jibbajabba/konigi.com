But what I didn't know until I "found out what it really was," to quote Seth Meyer, was that it is for me better and more than I want from a netbook. I have a netbook. I use it so rarely that I ended up just tethering it to our second TV in the house. The iPad I use daily, because it is fun and it replaces my computer for a lot of things.</p><p>Yesterday I came across yet another article saying iPad wasn't serious enough and that Apple would fail, as it did the PC market. There are a lot of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ipad+is+a+toy">articles on this theme</a>, attempting to mostly compare it to laptops and netbooks. They said the same thing about the iPhone as well. I don't think these people get it.</p><p>Last night I tweeted, "I've been reading articles dismissing iPad as a toy & not a tool, as if to say toys have no value. Guess what? Toys are fun."</p><p><a href=http://twitter.com/MichaelSurtees/status/12614483471>Michael Surtees replied</a>, "interesting @konigi —have you read the next big thing will start out looking like a toy at cdixon.org <a href=http://bit.ly/6MZqQR>http://bit.ly/6MZqQR</a>"</p><p>Chris Dixon's blog entry, "<a href=http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/>The next big thing will start out looking like a toy</a>" nails it on the head. This is a disruptive device that people don't seem to understand and appear to be dismissing without really experiencing it long enough to know why it's interesting. These are the people that focus on the feature set only, and don't think about the bigger ripple this will make in expanding people's use with both the personal and networked experiences. The similarities in the confusion the iPad is creating among people who don't get it are similar to those initial reactions with the Wii, Twitter, iPod, and iPhone.</p><p>For one thing, the experience (the interface and interaction) is the product. You don't get it until you live with it. It was the same with those examples above. And when you get, you get it big. There's the same gratification of understanding the multi-touch gestures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4EbM7dCMs">Two year olds</a> get that. I even caught my 9 year old son trying to swipe the LCD on our camera last week. Then slowly you get that it's useful in ways you didn't expect and that most importantly, it's more fun than you thought it would be. The apps help there. You like it. You like enough that you bring it everywhere and because it's bigger than your iPhone, you realize it's more usable for things like watching movies or playing Plants Vs Zombies.</p><p>Yes, there are limitations. After years of believing and playing the feature wars game with Windows Mobile and Palm, I had a hard time with the iPhone initially. But I used the iPhone more and more and never regretted that I can't use Excel or whatever else I could do with those smart phones that really were "tools" crammed into a PDA disguised as a phone. This is the longest I've stuck with one brand of phone, and you want to know why? It's because I enjoy using it.</p><p>The iPad is no different to me than the iPhone when it comes to the experience of the apps. There are tools on it that I'm going to make an effort at using. By tools, I mean those that aren't just media consumption apps. I'm making an effort to try to use OmniGraffle, Sketchbook Pro, and Pages. They won't be replacements for my Mac versions, but they will be stand-ins when I'm away from the desk. In those situations, it is good enough, and I think with time I will learn to work simply and it may turn out to provide better experiences. To speed my adoption, I'm experimenting with leaving pen and paper at home.</p><p>iPad is brutally selective on features, and comes up short compared to the world of user expectations. There is no camera, there is no 3G yet, there is no multi-tasking yet, and there is no printing. It builds off the experience of the iPhone, and it expands it to include the utility of the apps for simple productivity and creativity, while keeping the size and weight lean, and the battery life satisfying for an entire day. It even excels providing simpler experiences than those the tool-overloaded laptops and netbooks can provide. It's an everyday experience, it's a conference device, it's a commuter device.</p><p>Yes, it is a toy to me, but I don't say that to put it down. Toys make me happy. I can't remember the last time a tool really made me as happy.</p><p><a href=http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/><a href=http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/>http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Thursday, Apr 22, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/design>design</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/innovation>innovation</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/simplicity>simplicity</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/axure-better-defaults-library-v2/>Axure Better Defaults Library v2</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://www.acleandesign.com/2010/04/axure-better-defaults-library-v2/><img src=//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4bc4a180be46d_large.jpg></a></div><p>If I were an Axure user, this is what I would be using.

If you haven't seen him demonstrate this, you might want to <a href=http://www.davegrayinfo.com/2008/04/08/forms-fields-and-flows/>watch this video now</a>. In the video he illustrates for us how sketching is just combining forms and lines, and all you really need to be able to come up with pictures is to see and use these basic shapes.</p><div class=video><embed src=http://blip.tv/play/wBax+SEC type=application/x-shockwave-flash width=610 height=495 allowscriptaccess=always allowfullscreen></embed></div><p>See also Dave's <a href=http://www.davegrayinfo.com/2009/02/05/some-basic-rules-for-napkin-sketching/>Basic Rules for Napkin Sketching</a> after you've seen the above.</p><p>I remember drawing as a kid, feeling frustrated sometimes because I couldn't make things look the way they do in real life. I didn't really understand representational drawing until I started painting. In examining volumes, I was able to find a more basic understanding of the 2 dimensional shapes, and began drawing with ease. But it all came together when I took a Manga drawing class and started drawing characters that I really saw everything in this world of 2d and 3d shapes and polygons.</p><p>Drawing representationally shouldn't be the goal in sketching. It should be capturing an idea with rough, basic shapes. I think wanting to draw representational renderings is what held me back so much when I was younger, but embracing the basic shapes is what propels me now. After a while, you learn the alphabet and the pictures come easily if you continue to use the langauge.</p><p>I have a feeling these videos will come in handy very soon as tablets flood the market. Brushes and SketchBook Pro for the iPad will certainly provide another way for us to sketch.</p><p><a href=http://www.davegrayinfo.com/2008/04/08/forms-fields-and-flows/><a href=http://www.davegrayinfo.com/2008/04/08/forms-fields-and-flows/>http://www.davegrayinfo.com/2008/04/08/forms-fields-and-flows/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Friday, Apr 2, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/sketching>sketching</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/life-below-600px/>Life Below 600px</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://www.iampaddy.com/lifebelow600/><img src=//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4bb5f8925942a_large.jpg></a></div><p>Paddy Donnelly <a href=http://www.iampaddy.com/lifebelow600/>flips the bird at the fold</a>.</p><p><blockquote>What I'm proposing is for you to think twice about these ‘rules’ which are preached so often around the web and aim to create something original.

In his great diagrams he shows how the orginal flow frustrated diners (users) and could be easily re-designed to consider a flow that was immediately understandable--the design he experienced made him feel stupid. Sound familiar?</p><p>I think about interior spaces like lines at Whole Foods, where sometimes it makes absolutely no sense (I'm looking at you Columbus Circle) and where other lines seem to have considered this (Union Square sometimes feels efficient). Whole Foods has the problem of not having enough real estate to manage their volume unfortunately.</p><p>I remember experiences from my childhood, however, in places like Disney World, where the wait didn't always seem so incredibly grueling because lines are split off to feel shorter, and because distractions make the line feel like part of the experience. Ugh, I take that back. That now makes me think about creative "Loading..." dialogs in Flash. Actually, come to think of it, there are some pretty cool loading experiences in games that give you something fun to do. I also experienced the same with the credits when we recently finished Super Mario Wii.</p><p>Jon's article is a must read, if only to think about the problem solving we do and how it is applicable in physical contexts. There's so much opportunity, but I think how unfortunate it is that we don't have UX designers in important places. I think of all the time following the "hanging chad" Florida elections and how poorly designed the polling place in my district in Brooklyn remains, for instance. There's no shortage of UX design need out there.</p><p><a href=http://feedgrids.com/originals/post/ux_lessons_learned_from_offline_experiences/><a href=http://feedgrids.com/originals/post/ux_lessons_learned_from_offline_experiences/>http://feedgrids.com/originals/post/ux_lessons_learned_from_offline_experiences/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Friday, Apr 2, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/physical-spaces>physical spaces</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/user-experience>user experience</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/user-flow>user flow</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/interaction10-how-design-experience-experience-designers/>Interaction10: How to Design an Experience for Experience Designers</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://www.fastcompany.com/1597697/behind-the-scenes-at-interaction10><img src=//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4bad3ae7b2390_large.jpg></a></div><p>Jennifer Bove writes for Fast Company about how she and Bill DeRouchey designed the conference experience in "<a href=http://www.fastcompany.com/1597697/behind-the-scenes-at-interaction10>Interaction10: How to Design an Experience for Experience Designers</a>."

Not news to you, but his take looks at what that means regarding innovation from a sustainability perspective. I found it thought-provoking in other ways as well. The main idea is this. Forward-looking designers and business or policy decision makers may have a greater role and influence regarding designing sustainability products than customers.</p><p>The article tells the story of the Toyota Prius, which emerged during a time when the SUV reigned supreme in the US, and customer desire reflected that interest more than any desire for small cars that had less of an impact on the environment. The proposal to produce that innovation came from a vision that started within company.</p><p>Verganti believes that decision makers "need to step back from current dominant needs and behaviors and envision new scenarios. They need to propose new unsolicited products and services that are both attractive, sustainable, and profitable." It's an interesting story from many perspectives, with environmental impact being only one.</p><p>To dumb the discussion down a little, because I feel more comfortable with my smaller ideas, I'll tell you a silly story from my youth. When I was a teenager, I used to hang out occasionally at this record shop to pick up vinyl. I, like countless male Filipinos in NJ could mix and would DJ now and then. This guy who owned the record shop, his name was Spike, would play whatever new stuff had come in that he thought I would want to play, or I would ask him if he had stuff that I wanted. He knew tracks that I would hum to him after hearing them in the city clubs I'd go to. He was like the reference librarian of the DJs to me.</p><p>In those needle drop sessions we would chat about what we had played and what the reaction was. One day I remember asking him what he did when people would ask for something he would refuse to play. As you can imagine, as a teenage boy, it's hard to ignore girls who come up to ask you to play something for them. His answer was this. "You play them <strong>what you decide they need to hear</strong>, not what they ask for. You're the dealer and they come to you because you know what's good for them." Or at least that's how I remember it. Not sure about the drug dealer analogy.</p><p>I laugh when I think about that story, mostly because it was funny. I thought, well that's what separates one type of DJ from another. But I based what I would play on that idea. A DJ is like a curator. Mixing ability is one thing, but it's nothing without taste and experience designing the vibe of the night. Or something like that.</p><p>So oddly enough, after reading this HBR article, I think back to this Spike story and think about the role of the designer and what we do with our user research. I think modeling products based on what we believe customers need to do is necessary. But somewhere in that process there's also this need to go on something else. Taste, authority, gut? It's something more like vision based on those things.</p><p><a href=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/03/user-centered_innovation_is_no.html><a href=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/03/user-centered_innovation_is_no.html>http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/03/user-centered_innovation_is_no.html</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Friday, Mar 26, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/environment>environment</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/innovation>innovation</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/user-centered-design>user-centered design</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/design-web-and-craft/>Design, the web, and craft</a></h2><section class=article-body><p>I'm a little late on getting to this one, but wanted to post before I forgot because it is a great topic for early and mid-career web designers. <a href=http://www.emenel.ca/post/407052566/design-the-web-and-craft>Matt (emenel) reacted</a> to Mark Boulton's <a href=http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/on-designers-writing-html>thoughts</a> about whether or not designers needed to know html.</p><p>Matt summarizes what he believes:</p><p><blockquote>As a designer there is a continuum you travel over the course of your career. It starts with making - crafting objects in your selected medium - and progresses through a point where you internalize your craft and can design without making. Even at that point, most designers continue to make things. It helps solidify design choices, and keeps you in touch with changes in the medium. Career wise, at this point you might be an art director, creative director, or design director… Before that point it is imperative that designers engage with their medium and craft - wether it be websites, clothes, telephones, chairs, or responsive environments.</blockquote></p><p>Matt's post started with an observation of fashion designers, through watching Project Runway. These designers are judged not only on concept, but also on execution, or inability to execute. I think this is one profession in particular where the craft of constructing and prototyping are important. You see it when looking at process. Some designers make cartoonish sketches and others beautiful concept drawings. But in the end, the concept can't stand alone if they're judged equally on execution.</p><p>Learning html for Mosaic is one of the reasons I was drawn to the web. It was like taking a toaster apart only to learn how to put it back together. I took my first job basically to apprentice, even though I would be learning most of the HTML techniques on my own and through mailing lists like ALA. All that time and experience helps me every day that I draw a UI schematic. The immersion over time is what makes it become part of your language, and gives you the confidence to design without limitations.</p><p>I don't think that everyone needs to create production-quality html. I agree with Matt on the main point here. UX designers benefit from developing a working knowledge of the craft of html and css, and should at least put in some time working on prototypes to understand the capabilities of the medium. Even if new designers only work on personal projects, the experience helps them if they never use that skill in producing a deliverable. At best, it gives one the ability to personally demonstrate interactivity with a prototype resembling a working product if they have to.</p><p>The biggest point of contention may be whether they need to maintain this ability over time. I don't necessarily think that's true. I, like many other UX designers I know, are familiar enough with HTML to prototype, but are good enough at sketching or with using tools to demonstrate ideas so that someone better suited to building the interactive prototype can execute. That's not to say that we'll all let those skills drop by the wayside as our careers mature. I certainly try to prevent that from happening, which is one of the reasons I blog. But there are resources that can prototype faster and better once we select and refine an idea enough. In the end, execution for me means communicating a refined concept, and doing that doesn't always mean making html or writing code. But the process certainly is informed by understanding it.</p><p><a href=http://www.emenel.ca/post/407052566/design-the-web-and-craft><a href=http://www.emenel.ca/post/407052566/design-the-web-and-craft>http://www.emenel.ca/post/407052566/design-the-web-and-craft</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Wednesday, Mar 24, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/craft>craft</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/css>css</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/html>html</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/html-prototyping>html prototyping</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-templates-and-stencils/>iPad Templates and Stencils</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://emilychang.com/2010/03/ipad-templates-and-stencils/><img src=//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4ba2a3e3dba8d_large.jpg></a></div><p>Emily Chang rounds up the offering of <a href=http://emilychang.com/2010/03/ipad-templates-and-stencils/>iPad UI stencils</a>.

The increase in conversion can't necessarily be attributed to one thing in this case since there are many other variables from A to B.</p><p>Patrick McKenzie noted that you should test with your own users. He experimented with inline form fields <a href=http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/02/27/lesson-from-madlibs-signup-fad-do-your-own-tests/>in his A-B test</a> and found that conversion rates decreased. His form design, however, was a bit harder to parse than the KBB example. Some argue that the agenda there seemed to be to disprove the effectiveness of the mad libs style.</p><p>There's even more discussion about issues with the A-B test <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1151052">at Hacker News</a>. So this looks like one to implement with care and be sure to observe the results.</p><p>For what it's worth, I find short inline forms to be effective, and useful given space constraints. The login form on this site, for instance works within a short strip of real estate. It's not really the same as the longer forms--the mad libs style seems to take about a paragraph rather than sentence--but it's similar in that it departs from the typical quick parsing of a skimmable columnar layout to prose style reading.</p><div class=notebook-image><a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/4398925765/ title="Konigi inline login form by jibbajabba, on Flickr"><img src=//farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4398925765_97d66122f0_o.png width=610 height=117 alt="Konigi inline login form"></a></div><p><a href=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007><a href=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007>http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Monday, Mar 1, 2010 in <a href=http://konigi.com/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/forms>forms</a></li><li><a href=http://konigi.com/tags/mad-libs-style-form>mad libs style form</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=http://konigi.com/blog/michael-join-balsamiq/>Michael to Join Balsamiq</a></h2><section class=article-body><p><p class=dek>This is going to be big.</p></p><p>I've been keeping a secret for a few months, that I'm finally able to share with my friends and colleagues who follow Konigi. Today I'll be bringing my love of interface design to the small team at Balsamiq. I will be joining Peldi, Val, Marco, Luis, Mariah, and Malcolm, my new family at the company that introduced software and web designers to the fun and easy way to create quick, sketch-style wireframes with Balsamiq Mockups.</p><p>This move is the right change for me at the right time. I'll be able to marry my experience at working in-house on an evolving product, with my love of creating tools that advance my craft and sharing that knowledge and toolset with the UX design community. The move also represents the need at this point in my career to find a small group of passionate people that feel like family, that share my values, and that have a commitment to delivering a fun, simple product that people love to use.</p><p>I've communicated with Peldi off and on in the past few years. We actually made contact initially because we both wrote daddy blogs a while ago. Every time I've spoken to Peldi since, it feels like talking to a brother, and his enthusiasm is absolutely infectious. We've ended some Skype calls giving high fives on screen, which felt at once nerdy and totally awesome. He's a natural leader, and I respect his commitment to transparency and doing good. When I've chatted with Val, Marco, Luis, and Mariah in the past few months, I felt that same kind of warmth and enthusiasm, and I knew I found my home.</p><p>I can't wait to start doing the work. I think we can expect that I'll be working on the user experience for Mockups Desktop and the myBalsamiq web app. My goal is to support the team in continuing to improve the overall experience with Balsamiq products, from providing support and fielding customer needs to bringing rigor to the design of every product feature. There's a clear vision for simplicity and quality in this team, and I want to help fulfill that. This is going to be big, and as you can tell, I'm having a hard time containing my excitement.</p><p><a href=http://www.balsamiq.com/blog/2010/03/01/michael-angeles-joins-balsamiq/>Read Peldi's announcement on the Balsamiq</a>.
