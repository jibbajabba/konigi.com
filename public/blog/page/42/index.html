    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofeyecandy"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt49f1cf4912a1f.jpg"/></a></div><p>There are quite a few nice takeaways from Stephen P. Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofeyecandy">article in A List Apart</a>, a discussion in defense of the value of visual design beyond more than just aesthetic skinning of functionality. I like this one where he flips the notion that things are enjoyable because of how they function by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]hings that are enjoyable will be easy to use and efficient.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is connected with the user&rsquo;s belief that attention to design detail is related to quality. This notion was tested by Don Norman and written about in the book <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=h_wAbnGlOC4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=emotional+design#PPP13,M1">Emotional Design</a></em>. In it, Norman explains how our brains work:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hen we are relaxed, our brains are more flexible and more likely to find workarounds to difficult problems. In contrast, when we are frustrated and tense, our brains get a sort of tunnel vision where we only see the problem in front of us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anderson writes that the most direct way to influence decisions or perception is through the emotions. The final point is that user experiences should integrate form and function holistically, or as Frank Lloyd Write puts it, &ldquo;“form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.” I like that. </p></p>

    <section class="article-body"><p>David Malouf believes that "most successful products create a sense of connectedness between the consumer and the designer and that this connection occurs when designers balance the pull towards the rational, functional, &amp; expedient with the natural &amp; emotional."</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/magazine/2009/04/function-to-connection/">article on Johnny Holland</a>, David looks more deeply at what it means for an end-user to be connected to a product. He first looks at how art creates connection with humanity. It is the type of soulful connection that we experience in master works of art that either reach universal touch points, or resonate with us at a level that transcends pure aesthetic appreciation. David considers what it might mean to connect the user experience with the user on that kind of level. </p>
<blockquote><p>[S]oul comes through a feeling of connectedness. The ... flick of the iPhone is more than just a great metaphor: it is a calling card. It is that random sign that is completely analog in its interpretation. No machine could have ever conceived that. Apple through almost all of their products have become expert at adding these “human” touches in their designs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Great design in the end will give us something to relate to, to feel connected with, and to reinforce our humanity. Tapping that right balance between emotion and logic, chaos and control, analog and digital, is the key to this success. We can no longer rely on “form follows function”. Form has to be parallel to function, as function is growing in commodity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this is a wonderful look at how function can be abstracted to create experiences that seem natural over time and have a human feel. </p>
<p>There are other characteristics of the experience that I think might help products bridge the gap between purely functional existence to sympathetic, connection-seeking being, by also touching elements other than the designed object or interface. Take the use of language in interfaces for example.  Simply choosing the right interface to approach natural conversation without being cheeky can sometimes achieve this connection. </p>
<p>The point that purely providing functional products is no longer adequate for survival can't be understated. If companies want to differentiate themselves and retain loyal customers, design is what will separate all of the generic products from those that create connection with the user.  </p>

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/change-og-group-keys-2.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>Here&rsquo;s a tip that I blurted out on Twitter in a moment of frustration. I use both Adobe Illustrator and OmniGraffle, and one thing that repeatedly trips me up is using the keyboard shortcuts for grouping/ungrouping between the two apps. Illustrator uses Cmd-G to group, and OmniGraffle uses Shift-Cmd-G. They add the Shift key because CMD-G is assigned to search again which I don&rsquo;t use all that often.</p>
<p>The fix for this, as well as for any Mac application is simple. </p>
<p>1) Open System Preferences &gt; Keyboard and Mouse settings. </p>
<p>2) Select Keyboard Shortcuts in the control bar. Now scroll down to Application Keyboard Shortcuts.</p>
<p>3) Click the Add button and you&rsquo;ll see the dialog above to add keyboard shortcuts. I&rsquo;ve shown you how to re-assign the Group command. </p>
<p>4) Now re-assign the commands for UnGroup and Find as above or using whatever seems intuitive to you.</p>
<p>Now you won&rsquo;t need to know you OG from your AI keyboard shortcuts.</p></p>

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/04/09/dear-designer-you-suck"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt49dfb1283a59c.jpg"/></a></div><p>Khoi Vinh wrote an entry on taking <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2009/04/09/dear-designer-you-suck">the need for criticism</a> inside the studio, and extending that openness in engaging in critical dialogue to discussion with peers outside of your working groups.</p>
<blockquote><p>Like it or not, you can’t have a serious discourse about an art form until you have people whose sole involvement in that art form is criticism. You need, in effect, an independent press. Actually, to be clear, what you need is an economic model that can support a corps of passionate, clear-thinking individuals who are dedicated to vigilantly watching over the progression of the medium. Recent troubles aside, this is why art, film and architecture have achieved such great heights in our society: those art forms are economically robust enough to support a vibrant critical class.</p>
<p>Design is far from having that. Especially the design forms to which I’m closest: graphic design, Web design, interaction design. We have lots of smart people writing actively about design, pushing ourselves to do better design, but we have very few design critics who remain apart from the practitioners. We need more. </p></blockquote>
<p>I, like many of you I&rsquo;m sure, succeed because of the design critique. The design crit allows us to view design solutions among peers who can vet every aspect of what&rsquo;s been designed&ndash;the good and bad&ndash;from the perspective of someone other than the designer presenting the concept. Questioning what we&rsquo;ve done and why and suggesting alternative views that we might not have considered allows the designer to move forward and find the right design. If you do creative work to be used by others, you can&rsquo;t understimate the value of peer criticism. </p>
<p>But the design crit is a civil dialogue and public criticism outside of the controlled environment of the studio can be very different, and often personal. Opening up to criticism in the general sense, is partially why I take the risk of blogging. The risk in blogging is opening yourself up to criticism by sharing what you believe when you write or sharing how and what you do when you design. Something in what Vinh writes resonates with me. I&rsquo;ve always flinched a little when I&rsquo;ve read people criticize stuff I do indirectly, e.g. on Twitter, on comments in some blog. But I seek it out. And I try to react to it in a civil way because I learn from it. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the idea of being open to criticism outside of teams you&rsquo;re directly involved with, and feeling open to being critical. If you know my writing style, you know I can be tentative and polite about things I disagree with in the showcase entries. But I do think that the entries are most interesting when there&rsquo;s something to have a dialog about. To be sure, I&rsquo;m not creating a design pattern gallery here. I&rsquo;m documenting examples of the good, the different, and the not so good in order to find things that challenge my ideas and see what I feel about them. Somewhere in there there is criticism. </p>
<p>I like what Khoi is writing here, because it feels like he&rsquo;s inviting a change in the tenor of our discussion by saying that he wants more of it. I&rsquo;m certainly interested in doing the same, particularly as it regards user interface design.</p></p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/hunkering-putting-disorientation-design-process/">Hunkering: Putting Disorientation into the Design Process</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p>Jared Spool talks about "<a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/hunkering">visual disorientation</a>," a designer's technique for evaluating your design work in the middle of a process. It's certainly common to see designer's tack up pieces of paper around their project space, e.g. schematics, pictures with references to other objects that provide inspiration, etc. Hunkering, however, is more of a technique to create disorientation and change in one's perspective momentarily, to assess what you've done. </p>
<blockquote><p>Visual disorientation is a fast way to identify the places where things don't quite match up. Hunkering, in its simplest form, is a chance to force a moment of visual disorientation -- to make things seem foreign and out of place.</p>
<p>Hunkering gives the designer a chance to get lost in the reality of their design. Like visiting a vacation spot you've only seen pictures of, the initial impression takes a little getting used to. Then, once you've had a chance to orient yourself, to find the familiar elements you were expecting and place them relative to each other, the vacation spot becomes more comfortable. But in those places where the pictures didn't match the reality, that's what will stand out.</p>
<p>Hunkering, and its subsequent visual disorientation, can be a crucial tool for the designer. Used properly, it can prevent downstream errors and give new insights into the final results.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of the ways we may hunker is by simulating walkthroughs, prototyping, or rendering parts of rough ideas in higher fidelity. It's a process of: stepping back, looking, and seeing the forest for the trees; thinking, questioning, and orienting; and finally returning from the mountain top view to start back into work.</p>

It helps you see the whole of your screen and look for anything that stands out, and see what needs to draw more attention, depending on the priority and hierarchy of your page elements. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly useful for visual designers, but can be just as useful for interface designers. Another thing I do related to this is zoom out and turn my wireframes into visual thumbnails on the screen. </p></p>
