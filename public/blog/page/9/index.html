  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?968"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4b30ef2e07cab_large.jpg"/></a></div><p>I finally made some time to read through Luke Wroblewski&rsquo;s excellent review of the <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?968">changes in the Apple store&rsquo;s redesigned checkout form</a>. According to Wroblewski, &quot;&hellip;retail sales data shows that Mac sales were up 21% year-over-year in the months of October and November. So it&rsquo;s interesting to note that Apple&rsquo;s primary online sales channel (Web-based checkout) was redesigned during this time.</p></p>

<p>I wasn't surprised that the single page checkout form is an improvement over the paged version. What I was particularly interested in reading was Luke's observations about the problems with the move to put labels in inputs on so much of the form, and the improvements made with error messaging and breaking up secondary actions via tabbed sections.</p>

<p>I consider this a must read, and as always it's great to read whatever Luke continues to provide as an update to the form book. <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?968">Read it on Functioning Form<a>.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam based usability startup has been making impressive progress since their launch nearly six months ago.  With the help of beta testers Usabilla have been able to build a useful tool to collect feedback on webpages, mockups, sketches, and other images. According to their press release, more then 2500 usability experts, web designers, online marketeers and other web professionals are using Usabilla to conduct remote usability tests and collect feedback.</p>

<p>I have been a beta user of Usabilla during their pre-release this year, and Usabilla is a Konigi sponsor.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>As you may know, I've been working on an html prototyping toolkit that's in its infancy, and available to play with in pre-release form <a href="../project/protokit.html">here on Konigi</a>. What you also may know is that I hope to put the code in a repository so that people can contribute UI component markup/css/js to it, but what I've got is not mature enough yet.</p>

<p>A few people have already started sharing their ideas and tips with me and I've felt like it's kind of a waste to have some of these discussions happen offline, so I want to step out and start these discussions in a wider venue.</p>

<p>I've created the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/htmlprototyping">HTML Prototyping</a> Google group so that those of us who are interested in going deep on HTML wireframes or prototypes can talk about what we're doing and how we're doing it. Hopefully we'll give each other advice and find ways to learn new techniques or refine our craft. The group is NOT intended to focus on what I'm doing with the protokit, but is there for anyone who's using any method to do HTML prototyping. I will be there every day to monitor and participate.</p>

<p>I will look at every member that comes through this group and promise to try to keep the discussion on topic and keep flaming, trolls, spamming, and advertising from littering the list. So if you're interested, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/htmlprototyping">sign up and introduce yourself</a>.</p>

<p>Let's go.</p>

While Mac close icons are on the left by convention, Chrome positions them to the right of the tab and keeps them visible, while Safari positions them to the left and only displays the close icon on hover. I initially had to relearn the close button position because Firefox also places them on the right.  Both handle tab resizing in a way that allows you to close multiple tabs while keeping the cursor in one position while clicking the close icon repeatedly.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking of two things a lot with the holidays arriving. The first is, how can I provide a discount on Konigi stuff to my friends who use the notepads and sketchbooks. The second is, how can I find a way to make my Christmastime donations interesting. When I was an avid Lala trader a few years ago, I tried to see if I could get one of the many CDs sleeves I marked back and vowed to make my donations coincide with the event. I never got a sleeve back, but made the donations anyway and was included in a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201191.html">WashPost article</a> because I tend do end of year charitable giving.</p>
<p>Last year I ran a discount code for Black Friday/Cyber Monday. This year, however, I thought I would forego a discount and instead donate 50% of all sales revenue&ndash;not just profit, but all sales&ndash; to 2 charities. I figure the cost of these little sketchbooks and tools is not so great, and we can all give a little while getting something back. The donations will be made to 2 local organizations devoted to fighting poverty and hunger. </p>
<h3>The Beneficiaries</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.robinhood.org/"><img src="../sites/konigi.com/ads/robinhood-logo.png" /></a><br />
<strong>Robin Hood</strong> is an organization that gives 100% of donations to poverty-fighting organizations with programs focussing on Early Childhood, Education, Jobs &amp; Economic Security, and Survival, and uses sound investment principles to sustain in its philanthropic mission. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodbanknyc.org/"><img src="../sites/konigi.com/ads/nyfb-logo.png" /></a><br />
<strong>The New York Food Bank</strong> organizes food, information and support for community survival and dignity. Working to end food poverty and increase access to affordable, nutritious food for low-income New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs, the Food Bank&rsquo;s initiatives focus on direct services, food sourcing and distribution, nutrition and health education, financial empowerment, disaster relief and policy and research.</p>
<h3>Participate</h3>
<p>Thanks for participating with me. <a href="http://shop.konigi.com/?q=store">When you buy one of the Konigi products in the store</a>, you are making a small contribution to these philanthropic organizations . I will be doing an update to the icons to help entice you to make your purchase. I feel fortunate to have something to trade for dollars in donations, and to have the help of my friends and readers.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><strong>NOTE: Protokit is no longer being developed, but is still available for you to poke fun at.</strong></p>
<p>Protokit was an experimental project to develop a toolkit for creating HTML prototypes. It uses the following open source libraries and plugins: <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>, <a href="http://ivorycity.com/blog/jquery-template-plugin/">jQuery Templates</a>, and <a href="http://ixedit.com/">iXEdit</a>. More information about the included libraries and their licensing agreements can be found in theREADME file.</p>
<p>Version 0.1 was the preliminary version and is very rough. It provides the libraries and a rudimentary set of templates to get you started while I make this thing a bit more than the ugly half cousin to our beautiful wireframes. Use will require knowledge of XHTML, CSS, and jQuery.</p>
<p>Prototokit is no longer being developed, but you can <a href="http://media.konigi.com/tools/protokit/projects/demo/index.html">view the prototype demo</a> and <a href="http://media.konigi.com/tools/protokit/doc.html">documentation</a>, or you may <a href="../files/konigi/protokit.zip">download version 0.1 here</a>.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="video">
<object classcodebase='http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'><param name='movie' value='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_0817090731.swf' ></param><param name='flashvars' value='i=26677' ></param><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' ></param><embed src="http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_0817090731.swf' flashvars='i=26677' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer' ></embed></object></div>
<p>This is a demo of an HTML Prototyping Toolkit that I&rsquo;ve assembled from a few open source libraries. The idea is to create something super light so you can sketch your wireframes in HTML.</p>
<h2>Using Templates</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a jQuery template for creating columns in a grid. </p>
<p>Columns look like this:</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre>
{cols}  &lt;&ndash; grid layout container
  {col12} &lt;&ndash; 12 unit column
  {/col}  &lt;&ndash; closed column
  {col12last}  &lt;&ndash; 12 unit column
                   last in container
  {/col}
{/cols}  &lt;&ndash; end of container
</code></pre><p>
You can try out the prototypes I&rsquo;m playing with here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.konigi.com/protokit/projects/tsi-proteus/index.html" title="http://www.konigi.com/protokit/projects/tsi-proteus/index.html">http://www.konigi.com/protokit/projects/tsi-proteus/index.html</a></p>
<p>If you have Firebug, inspect the page to see what the templates are building.</p>
<h2>Works with ixEdit</h2>
<div class="video">
<object classcodebase='http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0' width='560' height='345'><param name='movie' value='http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' /><param name='flashvars' value='i=27619' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><embed src="http://screenr.com/Content/assets/screenr_1116090935.swf' flashvars='i=27619' allowFullScreen='true' width='560' height='345' pluginspage='http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer'></embed></object></div>
<p>As I said above, this is meant to be super light and uses existing libraries. I&rsquo;ll start posting the code when it&rsquo;s cleaner.</p></p>

<p>This is fantastic presentation from Pentagram&rsquo;s Michael Bierut at The 99 Percent conference. Shows how a quiet, humble, and empathetic bedside manner can be such useful attributes in a designer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Renowned graphic designer Michael Bierut claims that he&rsquo;s not creative. Instead, he likens his job to that of a doctor who tends to patients  – &ldquo;the sicker, the better.&rdquo; Digging into the 86 notebooks he&rsquo;s kept over the course of his career, Bierut walks us through 5 projects – from original conception to final execution – extracting a handful of simple lessons (e.g. the problem contains the solution; don&rsquo;t avoid the obvious) at the foundation of brilliant design solutions.</p></blockquote>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/finding-focus-while-trying-work/">Finding Focus While Trying to Work</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p class="dek">How I try and occasionally succeed at finding focus.</p>
<p>Ambient information and notification is killing me; so much so I'm mostly avoiding email, I'm disabling Growl notifications for apps, and looking at stuff like Tweetie on my own time rather than leaving it always on.  I have to admit that I occasionally have a hard time focusing on tasks and have sometimes put more effort into tweaking my systems for getting things done than I should. All for the greater good of finding a better way to be productive, I say. I am of course fooling myself. </p>
<p>I have found some practices rather useful for getting things done, and mostly they involve 2 things: 1) turning off the ambient noise and, 2) looking at what needs to get done and getting to work. Here are some of the ways I try to do this.</p>
<h3>Reducing Noise</h3>
<p><strong>Checking Email</strong></p>
<p>Email is the one of the worst offenders for delivering noise to signal. When I need to focus, I try to turn off email for the greater part of the day. I check 2-3 times a day, e.g. 10AM, 1PM, 4PM.  I use an app on the Mac called Alarm Clock Pro that reminds me to check email at those intervals every weekday. I try not to look at email in between. I got the interval email reading idea from Caterina Fake, who <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caterina/3270176074/">captured a whiteboard</a> of a single tasking strategy that apparently someone must be using at Hunch. </p>
<p>Mozilla Labs is also working on a project called <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/raindrop/2009/10/22/introducing-raindrop/">Raindrop</a>, led the by the Thunderbird team, to address the issue of managing email and the countless notifications we get. Some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43332657@N06/3996189794/in/pool-raindropdesign">ideas in their first design iteration</a> look interesting if they can keep the experience simple. I just don't want another feed I have to watch if it doesn't boost signal to noise.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribing</strong></p>
<p>I've lost control of email, largely because of newsletters, email lists, and commercial advertisements. I used to be good at filtering out the noise, but somehow I got lazy and didn't continue to keep the noise out of the inbox. What I do when that happens is send those newsletters to folders via filters and check them on a periodical schedule if I must. Better yet, I unsubscribe to the ones I really don't read anymore but still receive. If they're good lists, they'll have an archive you can search when you need to. <a href="http://www.ixda.org/discuss.php">IXDA's email list</a> is an example that does the web archive exceptionally well.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with RSS</strong></p>
<p>I've left and returned to my feed readers so many times, saying I couldn't deal with reading everyone anymore. But when I started blogging again, I realized that I wanted to find a way to manage my feeds. I've tried using Email systems that digest daily all the most important feeds that I can't do without. I've tried using folders to filter my feed reader. I've tried watching the stream through a Friend Feed app. Every one of those just seemed to do nothing to turn down the stream and only let the interesting things through. What I do now is use a combination of services, and use the appropriate one for the amount of time I have available to read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tabbloid.com/">Tabbloid</a> is a service I use for a handful of tech industry rags that post too often. I want to skim them daily so I use Tabbloid to give me a daily email digest of posts. I send it to trash after I skim the titles if there's nothing of interest.</p>
<p><a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader's</a> Explore Popular items is useful for surfacing the most popular entries in your feeds. You seed the reader brain by telling it what items you liked (by clicking smiley icons) and it uses this information to help recommend items to you in the future. The Sort By Magic feed setting is another feature that surfaces items that may be of interest to you, based on what you've read and shared in the past.</p>
<p>I've also been using Shaun Inman's <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Feed a Fever</a> app, which surfaces the most linked to entries from your subscriptions and shows you a listing of all of the posts pointing to the original item. It has the other category filtering mechanisms you'd expect, but the Hot view is where I spend most of my time. The design is also very light and very easy on the eyes, which I can't say really for the Google Reader unless I use Helvetireader.</p>
<p><strong>Setting IM status</strong></p>
<p>I leave IM on, but use status messages for focus time. For example, I set to busy when busy. Duh. If I set status to available and I'm trying to get things done, I don't always respond immediately unless the IM is from a co-worker. </p>
<p><strong>Turn off Twitter</strong></p>
<p>I have to treat Twitter like email on focus days. I check only replies and DMs a couple times a day. Twitter can be a rathole that leads you down a trail of links that will suck your time dry if you let it. It's also full of great finds and useful information, but during focus time, it's just another hose to turn down. </p>
<h3>Focusing</h3>
<p><strong>Setting priorities</strong></p>
<p>For me this is the set of near and far set of targets. For some projects I create roadmaps. They can have 1 year and 5 year goals. For product development, I lean on the product roadmap, and I break those down into goals which can be plotted annually, quarterly, monthly, daily. But that exercise is kind of academic with so many factors and people involved&#8212;it's a moving target. Goals on the design projects I own  are easier to plot. But the general idea is to get the far out goals down, then work backwards listing all the steps that need to happen for the goal to be reached. </p>
<p>I know tons of books talk about how you do this, but for me it's just easy to do for a single project, up to a point. If you're good at this kind of thing, then it just means using some methodology, like David Allen's GTD to record it all and order it.</p>
<p><strong>Using tickler folders</strong></p>
<p>I'm a fan of David Allen, who created the productivity system "Getting Things Done," although I follow his system somewhat loosely using a combination of OmniFocus and notepads. The main idea that works for me is setting up tickler folders for recording the tasks/actions that need to be done and reminding myself of what needs attention.  Works with simple paper files to record and a system of tickler folders to hold the ordered files, as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ULWQ_tnM8&amp;feature=player_embedded#">Allen demonstrates in this video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Asking your computer to nag</strong></p>
<p>Making note of the time is one of those simple things I started to do to create a sense of awareness and urgency. I'm one of those people who tend to get lost in an activity and lose track of time; so much so that the day gets away and I wonder how mindful I've been while I was bobbing along. I use the Date/Time system preferences to announce the hour. It alerts me to how much time is passing away. Some people would find this annoying, I'm sure, but it actually keeps me in a state of constant, subtle panic. It's kind of like having a productivity pace maker.</p>
<p><strong>Using single app mode</strong></p>
<p>This is perhaps one of those things that writers do all the time, and I've only recently started using it when I'm writing. Option-Command-clicking an app in the dock opens it in single window mode, hiding other apps. This kind of happens automatically for me when I'm in Adobe tools in full screen mode, but in other tools that use floating palettes, it's easy for background applications to distract.</p>
<p><strong>Getting out</strong></p>
<p>That is to say, I try step away from the computer when I can. I am a remote guy on my team. I used to have an office, but now I work from home. Working from home can be kind of tough, so I try to get out a few times a week to work around others, and to have lunch or coffee with other designers in the NYC area. </p>
<p>When I have to focus, especially when I have to work out designs, I go out and sketch on paper in a cafe. I bring my computer usually, but sometimes it helps to go out without one and sketch somewhere different, where where I'll feel free from the constant bing of alerts. If people need to reach me they have my cell phone number, and I'm never far away from my office at home.</p>
<h3>Sometimes it actually works</h3>
<p>These are most of the things I can think of that I do. Sometimes it helps me focus, which is really good, because I have a hard time not getting distracted. The irony of this article is that because of it, I've whiled away an hour or so writing this when I could have been productive. What do you do to find focus?</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/10-myth-and-how-put-your-creative-process-autopilot/">The 10% Myth and How to Put Your Creative Process on Autopilot</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p class="dek">What if we could eliminate noise and give our brains space to do harder work or process different things?</p>
<h3>The Costanza Principle</h3>
<p>There's a particularly funny episode of Seinfeld titled "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abstinence">The Abstinence</a>," where George abstains from sex because his girlfriend has Mono, and strange things begin to happen to the serial underachiever. He appears to utilize more of his brain and becomes mentally sharp. He remembers where he left things years ago. He starts to read and understands math. He becomes more intelligent. Of course he ruined it all in a weak moment with a comely waitress.</p>
<p>That comedy sketch summarizes a simple and persistent myth that has stuck for years&#8212;that we use <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=do-we-really-use-only-10">only 10% of our brain</a>. That number may have more to do with 10 percent of our potential or capacity rather than 10% of brain use. But the idea sticks, I think, because of that hopeful notion of doing more than one thinks she is capable.</p>
<p>I thought of the Seinfeld sketch while I was reading Barry Schwartz's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">The Paradox of Choice</a></em> and it put me on a separate train of thought about creativity and productivity. What if we could take the idea of eliminating noise in order to give our brains space to focus, to do harder work, or to process different things? </p>
<p>Schwartz says that in effect we do this every day when we go into autopilot to take care of our morning routines&#8212;bathing, shaving, brushing, etc&#8212;because we don't need or want to waste time and effort considering choices all the time. So it started me wondering how this idea translates to the work I do.</p>
<p>The are two ways I thought this idea could have some benefit for me: first as a tool for freeing my mind in everyday creative activity, and second, as a tool for users of the things I design not to feel overwhelmed with choice and decision making.</p>
<p>So I started listing how I might make this idea work in each of those contexts. For now, I'm going to focus on how this relates to my creative process, and what I try to do that now seems related to this idea. </p>
<h3>Processes</h3>
<p>If I learn and use a technique or process, I write about it and when necessary turn it into a set of tools that support the process. I record the steps in the system for re-doing without having to re-learn. I modify what I learn and borrow from others when what I've gleaned limits my ability to get things done.</p>
<p>I've done this over and over with all of the information architecture and interaction design practices that I employ. I just stand on the shoulders of those who pioneer and test these processes, making use of what makes sense, and discarding aspects as needed. This is one of the aspects of agencies that I think is really great. Processes are so well defined for those inside and outside the agency to understand that it becomes part of the common language of the team.</p>
<h3>Tool Sets</h3>
<p>I find toolsets and frameworks for nearly everything I do, or I create them when I can't find them. They add rigor to my process, and allow me to re-use without thought. I break out of the frameworks as necessary, but start with a sense of the complete framework, even if only in concept, and expand to satisfy my use cases and needs.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned early in my career from Perl programmers I worked with is that code libraries help you to be lazy. Laziness can be a virtue if it means you don't want to sweat the routine and small things so you can focus on the bigger ideas. Designers also do this with design pattern libraries and component libraries. I don't limit myself to only what libraries provide, but I do exploit them when they're useful and save me time and effort.</p>
<h3>So what does this buy you?</h3>
<p>I think to sum up, this all comes back to the idea of freeing your mind from the tyranny of small decisions, so you can focus on the bigger, more intellectual or creative ones. A lot of this isn't exactly auto-pilot, or may not feel that way in the beginning. But after years of developing and evolving these things, I feel some of the routines or toolsets I've created have become a part of my vocabulary. The only problem is maybe that other things compete for the open space I create. I have more to say about that, and the issue of focus, but will leave that to another entry. </p>
<p>I'll end as I often do with a question. What kinds of things are you doing to put your work life on autopilot?</p>

They did this by simply requiring that real eggs be used in making cakes, rather than incorporating powered egg, and marketed this as a benefit. </p>
<p>Brignull sums up the use of psychology in the creation of this story and sense of role as a clever manipulation of the user experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>[P]sychologists realized the customer wanted to play the role of a successful home-maker and cook. We could even go so far to argue that their customers may have felt societal pressures to perform this role well. The egg, therefore, becomes more than an ingredient, and more than just an extra pleasurable step. It becomes a prop, enabling the customer to play a social role.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brignull points out that we can make that comparison to usability and efficiency vs. the creation of emotional contact and the feeling of satisfaction. The egg stands in place of some role that enables some aspect of the fulfilling experience. Looking at the experience from this perspective has so much to do with understanding the customer, and what they want to get out of making cakes.</p></p>
