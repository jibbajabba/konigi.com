  <section class="article-body">  <p class="dek">Jumping in and immediately starting to build the product, even if it does get completed and ship, is almost guaranteed to produce a mediocre product in which there is little innovation or market differentiation. When you have only one kick at the can, the behaviour of the entire team and process is as predictable as it will be pedestrian.</p>

<p>He points out three characteristics of a hypnotic trigger:<br />
<ol><li>Uniqueness - it should be something (or a combination of things) you don't associate with other activities, otherwise the effect will be diluted.</li><br />
<li>Emotional intensity - the kind you experience when you're really immersed in creative work.</li><br />
<li>Repetition - the more times you experience the unique trigger in association with the emotions, the stronger the association becomes.</li></ol></p>
<p>I live by daily routines, but I also associate that with my need to feel balanced and in control of my time and the living and working space around me. I also have a tendency to be impulsive or to dive very deeply into activities, so routine acts both as clock and trigger.</p>
<p>There are some excellent anecdotes about the routines of famous creatives. I find myself really intrigued by the more eccentric ones, like those of Victor Hugo and especially that of Orhan Pamuk. Pamuk's act of re-creating his &quot;walk to work&quot; trigger is pretty ingenious. <a href="http://the99percent.com/tips/7021/Why-Creative-People-Need-to-Be-Eccentric">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Sketching interfaces is a path focussed on generating many ideas and finding the right design. Lately I've been thinking about how to adapt the activity of physically sketching on paper to get the same results in Mockups. On the Balsamiq UX blog, I wrote about a technique I've been experimenting with to <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2011/04/28/sketching-in-mockups/">do sketchboards in Mockups using a Symbols library</a>. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/will-wright-game-play-and-education/">Will Wright on Game Play and Education</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22670388" width="610" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/22670388">Will Wright's talk</a> at the Summit on Science, Entertainment, and Education looks at how game play can be relevant to education. These are my notes from this talk.</p>
<h3>How we process information</h3>
<p>Our basic model for processing and acting on data that we receive in the world looks something like this:</p>
<p>- Behavior<br />
- Models (Predictive) ↑<br />
- Schema (Abstractions) ↑<br />
- Metaphors (Patterns) ↑<br />
- Examples (Data) ↑</p>
<h3>How our minds work when we play games</h3>
<p>Games become relevant in education because they offer a more effective way to use and build knowledge. </p>
<p>Game play is about:</p>
<p>- failing<br />
- changing your model<br />
- repeating</p>
<p>Game players, through experimentation and repeated failure, ramp their model of the game up over iterations of play. Their model becomes more complex as their understanding and ability to succeed increases over each interaction and learning experience.</p>
<p>Wright tells a story about a pottery class, in which a teacher tells one group of students that their grade will be based on one single pot they are produced. The second group is told their grade will be based on the amount of pots they produce. The second group ended up with the highest grades.</p>
<p>When your work is based on building the most rather than creating the perfect work, you fail repeatedly, update your model, and produce the best work.</p>
<h3>What makes a good educational experience</h3>
<p>Wright applies what James Paul Gee lists as attributes for a good education experience and says these are the same for game play.</p>
<p>- allow identity<br />
- offer a reason to do it<br />
- allow and mitigate risk<br />
- encourage failure<br />
- provide situated meanings: you're learning for things you immediately need<br />
- get you out of ordered problem solving</p>
<h3>Blurring the lines of maker/player</h3>
<p>In addition to becoming effective tools for learning, the game community is blurring lines between the game ecology and the community. Social experiences afforded by games like Spore and LIttle Big Planet are good examples. Players become creators and contributors. Learning and creation and contribution are one and the same.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://mobiledesign.org/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4d94cc3eba141_large.jpg"/></a></div><p>Brian Fling's book,  <em>Mobile Design & Development</em>, published by O'Reilly in 2009, is available to read in its entirety online. Fling says he says 75-80% of the content of the book (which is some 68,000 words) is up to date and extremely relevant as of March 2011.</p>
<p>More from the author:</p>
<p><blockquote>I wrote this book to have something for everyone interested in designing in developing for mobile devices, regardless of experience and regardless of the application. The first half is a crash course in the mobile ecosystem: how to develop a strategy, address the mobile context—even how to decide which of the multiple mobile application types is best for you, and finally, how to create a user experience for it. The second half is focused on using these principles to make a mobile website or web app.</p>
<p>This means this book isn't for anyone looking for a quick fix to the “mobile problem.” As I told my excellent editorial team throughout the writing process, “this is a book that teaches people how to cook, not a collection of recipes.” However being O'Reilly's first book on mobile, we decided to cover a lot of ground, basically detailing mobile from it's origins to the devices of tomorrow.</blockquote></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><p class="dek">Don't let anyone tell you that the tools you choose are wrong or inappropriate. Find the right design and keep winning.</p></p>
<p>Occasionally I'm asked to provide an opinion about a topic that people think I should have some authority to comment on for some reason. That topic, as you might guess, is wireframing.</p>
<p>I enjoy pointing people towards good resources, or helping them with a problem using a tool that I'm familiar with. I also love to give my own design resources to peers, or to teach techniques that I think will help people perfect their craft. In the end, I benefit from that exchange the most.</p>
<p>When asked to comment on slanted opinions that throw a stake in the ground and tend to confuse and divide the community, I abstain. Navel gazing and defining the damned thing became an uninteresting use of time to me long ago. It took some time immersed in those conversations to know that I have nothing to contribute. I'd rather be making stuff than talking about it. I just say call yourself whatever you like, and do whatever works.</p>
<p>Interface design tools are as good as you make them. When I started out, I had to use <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michael+angeles+visio">Visio</a> to communicate UI specs. It wasn't awesome, but I made it work. Later I found <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michael+angeles+omnigraffle">Omnigraffle</a>. It was not designed specifically to enable interface designers, but we made it awesome. We learned how to use it to make our documents communicate design ideas.</p>
<p>We are the ones who determine what's useful for us after immersion in tools. We've debated what we want in the ultimate IA tool, we've found parallels in other industries and fields of practice and made them our own. We've experimented with forward-looking low-fidelity prototyping projects like Denim, and pondered what the right suite of tools are for our work. Some of us built them and shared our work. Some of us are still building them.</p>
<p>Over years of working and watching others work, I've noticed that some attributes are common among the people whose work I admire. The people who are the most effective seem to continue to study their practice, and perfect their craft. After long hours of use, they find the way to flow within any app at their disposal, and become as fast and effective as they can using it. The key is what they do with the app once they've become expert at their craft, expert in finding the right design, expert in communicating, and expert in refining. There's some kind of maker/doer tenacity I see in people, and it doesn't have to do with any one tool.</p>
<p>There are no good or bad tools for finding the right design. Paper prototypes are your thing? Awesome. If you want to sketch and go right to building in HTML? Go for it! I've done it. You want to craft gray box schematics in OmniGraffle, Photoshop, or Mockups? Godspeed you wireframer. Maybe I can help you with that. You want to use a tool that generates interactive prototypes? Have a nice day. :)</p>
<p>All the side-taking is useless to me. If you've ever interviewed people for an IA or IXD position, you know that beautiful documents and prototypes are meaningless if in the end they don't demonstrate good problem solving and good design decision making. I don't care what people use. They can use finger puppets and crayons if they help them.</p>
<p>I say use whatever makes sense or is at your disposal. Your tools are only as effective as you are at using them to accomplish goals. But don't let anyone tell you that what you choose is wrong or inappropriate. Find the right design and keep winning.</p>

The idea is to create a cap with a conductive tip that will fit over a Sharpie, Bic, or Fineliner pen. Lehman's introductory video below shows the stylus cap at work.</p>

<p>Looks fantastic and simple, and you'll have one fewer thing to carry with you because it acts as pen and stylus. Sweet. You can help fund the project and reserve a cap by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1004382302/more-real-stylus-cap">heading to the Kickstarter page</a>.</p>

They've created an <a href="http://www.uistencils.com/products/ipad-dry-erase-white-board">iPad dry erase board</a> with dot grid, and updated their awesome <a href="http://www.uistencils.com/products/iphone-sticky-pad">iPhone sticky pads</a>. Definitely want to get my hands on the dry erase board.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong><br />
Mine arrived and I have to say that this is the nicest dry erase board I have now. It's made on hard particle board, similar to what you'd find on a clipboard, so it feels great in the hands. There's an interaction key laminated to the back with gesture symbols and common icons, to help you while you sketch. It comes with 2 fine point dry erase markers with eraser heads that work well.</p>
<p>I'm loving it, and so is my son, who plans to use it for stop motion animations. I'm not working on iPad design right now, so I'd love to have a few screen and browser dry erase boards, or a 6-up/8-up sketchboard for thumbnail sketches and storyboards.</p>

The end goal of the drawing process is what you learn while sketching.</p></p>
<p>I'm slowly getting back into the groove of reading blogs and updating this site after some time off to enjoy the first month with our new baby. I found 52 weeks' recent <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/346650933/sketch-sketch-sketch">post about sketching</a>, and loved the encouraging reminder for UX designers. I'll quote, because Joshua Brewer says it so well.</p>
<p><blockquote>[D]on’t worry if you can’t sketch. In fact, if you’re too good you might just fool yourself into thinking your sketch is a deliverable. It’s not. The real value of sketching is that it allows you to explore and refine ideas in a quick, iterative and visual manner with little overhead or learning curve. Rapid ideation around flow and interaction, layout and hierarchy, can be quickly established, rearranged or discarded wholesale—all without ever touching a computer.</blockquote></p>
<p>I like the reminder that sketching is thinking. For me, it is the thought process, decision making, and learning, not the quality of the product in this activity that makes sketching an important part of the design process. For me it even continues from sketch to wireframe. The lines blur when you can discard and start over easily and repeatedly in whatever medium.</p>

<p><blockquote>Designers sometimes use the word “refactor” in a loose way. I think they overhear the word from programmers without getting the precise meaning. This article will introduce the term to designers so they can gain the same advantages that programmers have from a clear understanding.</p>
<p>How do designers loosely understand refactoring? Many take it to mean “rearranging” a design or “adjusting without completely rethinking” it. Refactoring actually means something else. It means changing the way a design is built without changing the way it looks from the outside.</blockquote></p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/ipad-stylus-roundup-and-winner/">iPad Stylus Roundup: And the winner is...</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/ipad-styli.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></div><p>[Update: This review was updated after getting the latest version of the Stylus Socks.]</p>
<p>My search for the perfect stylus for sketching on the iPad is over. I've tried ever stylus I could get my hands on. The three finalists that earned a space on my desk or pocket in the past year have been the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iClooly-Stylus-iPhone-Devices-Version/dp/B0032J1NM0">iClooly</a>, the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/shapedad">Stylus Socks</a>, and the <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/stylus">Griffin Stylus for iPad</a>.</p>
<p><h3>Starting off on the wrong foot</h3></p>
<p>I started out initially playing with a few rubber tipped styli and the Pogo Sketch. I had to <a href="hacking-pogo-stylus-smoother-ipad-sketching.html">hack the Pogo Sketch</a> to make it glide, which I still think is an elegant hack. I even contacted the creator about my hack but he didn't seem to care much for the idea of having a plastic nib inserted in the conductive foam, so I gave up on that. All of the rubber tipped styli created too much friction to be useful, and I didn't see much promise in the hacks that involved scraping a metal snap across my glass screen. After those experiences I set out to find the perfect stick to take out with me to supplement sketching on paper.</p>
<p>I have 2 main criteria by which I judged the styli.</p>
<p><ol><br />
<li>The tip should glide smoothly with as little friction as possible on the screen so that sketching feels natural</li><br />
<li>The stick should be long enough to fit comfortably in the hand</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p><h3>The finalists</h3></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/iClooly-Stylus-iPhone-Devices-Version/dp/B0032J1NM0">iClooly</a> ($14.95)</strong><br />
The iClooly uses a small, soft metallic brush tip that seemed to glide the smoothest on the screen, but the metal stick is too thin and short to use comfortably for more than the shortest sketching sessions. I used this consistently for at least 6 months and found it exceptional. I came up with an <a href="hacking-iclooly-ipad-stylus.html">inelegant hack</a> to extend the stick, and that served me well, but who wants to use an ugly hacked stick?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/shapedad">Stylus Socks II</a> ($7)</strong><br />
The Stylus Socks II sold by Shapedad on Etsy are a clever solution that wraps the end of a plastic KOH-I-NOOR pen holder with a conductive fabric. My initial review of the Stylus Sock was based on my use of a prototype version, but I've since received the final version which includes a felt tip under the fabric. The best thing about this stylus is the long stick, which makes it the most usable of the bunch. At only $7 a stylus, this may be the best choice for the budget-conscious sketcher. It works very well and it feels good to support an independent maker. At this price I think this may be the perfect solution for most people. One thing I would like is a heavier version. I may try to purchase a metal pen holder and move the fabric over to that one.</p>
<p>Shapedad is also working on a prototype mouthstick for people who don't have use of their arms, prompted by a request to make a long stylus for a quadriplegic customer. You can watch his progress <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shapedad/5265910567/">in his Flickr photostream</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/stylus">Griffin iPad Stylus</a> ($18.99)</strong><br />
Someone finally tipped me to the Griffin iPad Stylus in November and I started watching the videos of users on YouTube and was easily convinced that it could be smooth enough. I was skeptical at first, but the rubber tip is surprisingly untacky and glides smoothly with little friction. It's slightly less smooth than the iClooly, but the biggest positive is that the stick is thicker and resembles the thickness of a pen or marker. It feels great in the hand, and it's long enough to  reach from my closed index finger and thumb to rest between the two fingers. The clip slides nicely onto the spine of my iPad cover.</p>
<p><h3>And the winner is...</h3></p>
<p>The Griffin was my initial winner among the three. Although it's the most expensive, it works well and I like the metal stick, which I found to be the right thickness. The clip also helps me keep it tethered to the iPad case. After I received the final version of the Stylus Socks II that included the felt tip under the fabric, I found this stylus to be equally as effective as the Griffin, and glides more smoothly. I think they're both good choices.</p>
<p>I still find sketching on paper superior to sketching on the iPad, but there are definite advantages to immediately having an image to share digitally. iPad sketching has a permanent place in my toolkit, and the Griffin is my weapon of choice. Hopefully this will be the last in this year-long series on finding the right tool for this task.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4d0b8cded76b0_large.jpg"/></a></div><p>I stumbled on Paul Irish and Divya Manian's <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> after looking for a solution to fall back on a local jQuery library if Google's CDN ever went south, and reading about how to use this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-from-google-cdn-fall-back-to-wp-local">technique for WordPress</a>. <a href="http://make-things.com/">Ben Kutil</a> also helped me undersand how the fallback technique works a little bit, and I tested and implemented on Balsamiq's site.</p>
<p>HTML5 Boilerplate is not a library, but a template and set of awesome examples for how to get started integrating HTML 5 into your sites. They provide techniques for future-proofing HTML/CSS/JS, with cross-browser normalization, performance optimizations, even optional features like cross-domain Ajax and Flash in mind. They also give you a starter apache .htaccess config file with caching rules and prep your site to serve HTML5 video, use @font-face, and use gzip.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. You can also watch a <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/the-official-guide-to-html5-boilerplate/">screencast of Paul Irish demonstrating</a> it on Nettuts.</p>

<p>This is one of the most practical uses of augmented reality I've seen. <a href="http://questvisual.com/">Word Lens</a> translates text you capture from an iPhone's camera to another language. I think it's only Spanish-English/English-Spanish at the moment, and $4.99 per language. </p>
<p>If you're skeptical, as some YouTubers seem to be in the comments, you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/tags/wordlens/">see an example</a> of the translation I did on my phone of an English magazine page to Spanish. Works best on big text, and probably most practical for signage. I need this for trips to Italy (my Italian is rough), so hopefully Italian will be available in the future.</p>

<p>It's 11/30, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=153180248051749">Blue Beanie day</a>. </p>
<p>It’s easy to show your support for web design done right. Beg, borrow, or buy a Blue Beanie and snap a photo of your mug wearing the blue. (Or get creative with Photoshop). Then on November 30, switch your profile picture in Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, (and any other social network) and post your photo to the Blue Beanie Day group.</p>

<p>We've release Mockups 2.0 at Balsamiq. The main feature in this release is the Symbols functionality. It allows you to reuse groups of controls in order to create templates, page masters, and libraries of re-usable components. This can be done globally for all of your projects, or locally within a single project. You can create symbols from the top down and the bottom up. There's some documentation for this somewhat advanced feature here: <a href="http://balsamiq.com/support/documentation/symbols">Working with Symbols</a>. To try it out, <a href="http://balsamiq.com/download">download or update</a> Mockups on your machine.</p>

<p>The iClooly is the pen I've been using most for quick sketches on the iPad, but for longer sketches and for drawing the handwritten font I'm making in iFontMaker, the short stick kind of sucks. </p>
<p>Extending the iClooly stick is an easy hack that almost doesn't merit a post: rip off the back, take apart a mechanical pencil, and mash the two together.</p>
<p><small>Verbose version: Remove the clicky end and the spring inside, making sure the brush is pressed down and the bristles exposed. Find a cyclinder that the iClooly will slide into--I'm using the plastic housing of a Sanford mechanical pencil--and push the iClooly into the cylinder. </small></p>

The <a href="http://www.sarahsampsel.com/blog/2010/11/08/designing-the-washington-post-app-for-ipad/">first entry</a> describes the types of interaction, visual design, and brand issues she had to consider when designing for the device. <a href="http://www.sarahsampsel.com/blog/2010/11/10/designing-the-washington-post-for-ipad-detailed-wireframes/">The second shows a few wireframes</a> of the evolution of the home screen design.</p>
<p>Would have been lovely to also see some of the sketches, but it's awesome that Sarah shared not just final wireframes, but a series of wireframes showing the iterations. I'm hopeful that she'll continue the series to discuss the visual design and some post-launch thoughts.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <p class="dek">Chance favors the connected mind.</p>
<p>I just picked up Steven Berlin Johnson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Come-ebook/dp/B003ZK58TA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1289309053&amp;sr=8-2"><em>Where Good Ideas Come From</em></a> after watching this sketch-note summarization of the ideas in the book.</p>
<div class="video">
<object width="610" height="367"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/NugRZGDbPFU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/NugRZGDbPFU?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="610" height="367"></embed></object></div>
<p>I became a fan of Steven's after reading the New Yorker article "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/magazine/24TV.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=e08bc7c1e7acbb59&amp;ex=1271995200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=">Watching TV Makes you Smarter</a>" and his book, <em>Everything Bad is Good for You</em>.  This one looks like it will be an interesting read. I'm hoping it's full of stories of long drawn out infancy of ideas, and the collisions and connections that make ideas succeed. </p>
