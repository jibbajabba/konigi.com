  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/dear-brooklyn-its-not-you-its-me/">Dear Brooklyn, It&#39;s not you. It&#39;s me.</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="screenshot"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/bk-mc.jpg" /></div>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending my final full week as a Brooklynite and feeling the bitter sweet pain of saying goodbye, while looking hopefully towards the next chapter of my life. After 19 years as a New Yorker, I&rsquo;m heading with my family to live in Marin County, CA. </p>
<p>New York is a city that I&rsquo;ve loved from childhood, and the only place I could see myself living as a young adult. With my head full of every cliché dream, I believed it was the place I needed to live to find myself. When I moved here I thought I would work in the art world, where I spent the first few years hustling, but I discovered my path was to lead elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve thrived in this inspiring city for a long time, and drew energy from this place. It&rsquo;s helped make me who I am today.</p>
<p>I spent a short time in the first few years living in Manhattan at Times Square and the East Village. The rest of my days were spent primarily in Brooklyn at Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill, Sunset Park, and in the last 9 years, Park Slope. If you know me, you know I&rsquo;ve considered myself a Brooklynite more than a New Yorker. There&rsquo;s an energy, creativity, diversity, and much more relaxed sense of being I&rsquo;ve found in Brooklyn that is wonderful. But nothing lasts, and although I thought I&rsquo;d live the rest of my days residing in Brooklyn, the pull to the outdoors became too strong. With 2 sons that need to bust out, break free from living in boxes, and restraining their boyish need to bounce and scream to be quiet for neighbors, the timing just feels right.</p>
<p>Many of the designers I&rsquo;ve come to know, respect and admire have been my neighbors here. This town introduced me to some incredibly smart people who have influenced me, from the original group of IAs that met in Victor Lombardi&rsquo;s IA Salon over 10 years ago, to the more recent impromptu gatherings Lou Rosenfeld, Yoni Knoll, and I have put together with our BK/UX peeps. I&rsquo;ve had a good run, and I&rsquo;ve met so many incredible people here who I hope to never lose as friends. I hope none of you hold it against me for leaving to the left coast, and I thank you for your friendship.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s with a little sadness that I say goodbye to New York, and with hopeful anticipation that I&rsquo;m welcomed to the Bay Area. If you&rsquo;re in San Francisco, know that I plan to spend a lot of time exploring in your beautiful city, and that I&rsquo;m always looking for like-minded UXers to have coffee with. I&rsquo;ve owed a few people a coffee date for years now. </p>
<p>See you on the other side.</p></p>

Every build and iteration requires review and circling back to evaluate the component in terms of the need identified in the use case scenario. Put into action, he says:<br />
How do we integrate the components back into a context for review? Ask the question: “What is the user trying to do here?” The job the user has in mind is the best integration point because the user’s mind doesn’t tidily follow the boundaries of implementation.</li>

The group meets frequently, literally sitting around a kitchen table, to debate all products under development. “We’ll sit there with our sketch books and trade ideas,” Stringer said, appearing as the first witness in the Apple vs. Samsung trial. “That’s where the really hard, brutal honest criticism comes in.”<br />
From there, the group puts the sketches into a computer-aided design program and, if warranted, creates a physical model. “Our role is to imagine products that don’t exist and guide them to life,” Stringer said. There could be 50 designs for a single button, he added. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said.&rdquo;</li>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/pace/">Pace</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt503901bbde9e1_large.jpg"/></a></div><p>Hannah Donovan&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/">essay in A List Apart</a> considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.</p></p>

<p>I've been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement. In the summer of 2011, I was fortunate enough to experience a very special meal on a very small farm/restaurant in Italy's Le Marche region. All the food and drink prepared is grown on the farm or sourced hyper-locally, from meat and vegetables, to wine—everything within 1 kilometer. It was the most profound eating experience of my life. Little bits and pieces of that day have made me think about how my approach to work and life have become more and more connected to each other, and how much of an impact one's production and consumption decisions have on the world.</p>

<p>From a design and lifestyle perspective, I like to reference this summary of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement">philosophy of the Slow Movement</a> by Professor Guttorm Fløistad, found on Wikipedia:</p>

<p><blockquote>The only thing for certain is that everything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you better speed up. That is the message of today. It could however be useful to remind everyone that <strong>our basic needs never change</strong>. The need to be seen and appreciated! It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for a little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations. In order to master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness. There we will find real renewal.</blockquote></p>

<p>It's a bit touchy-feely, and lives entirely in the center of Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. But the idea of taking a holistic approach to fulfilling needs in all things, provides the basis for actually satisfying them in other ways up the triangle. Specifically, I'm thinking of the idea of fulfilling the needs for esteem and self-actualization as one example. In a scenario where speed and volume has become the norm, how has that situation impacted our lives?</p>

<p>I like how Donovan tells the story of learning from the experience at <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> to imagine <a href="http://www.thisismyjam.com/">This is My Jam</a>, a product that goes the other way, and focuses on the quality and value of the experience, using pace as the point of pivot. I like this approach. I have mostly stopped consuming from the firehose, and seek out the products that deliver a signal that I get more value from, more satisfaction, or that fulfill my basic needs with less fluff and noise. The decision to work with a product and team that follows those ideals is important to me as well.</p>

<p>Beth Meredith and Eric Storm <a href="http://www.create-the-good-life.com/slow_design.html">summarize the concept of Slow Design</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote>Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.</blockquote></p>

<p>The Slow Movement is not just a lifestyle choice, but as designers, we can choose to have an impact on the world based on these ideals.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/jiro-dreams-sushi/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="video"><iframe width="610" height="343" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/I1UDS2kgqY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I got around to watching David Gelb&rsquo;s documentary, <a href="http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a> after seeing it making the rounds on the web repeatedly. I&rsquo;ve been on a documentary kick lately, and this has made it into the category of films I&rsquo;d re-watch. </p>
<p>The film looks at the life of celebrated sushi chef, Jiro Ono, whose small restaurant serves only sushi and requires a reservation 3 months in advance, and who is regarded as the most masterful sushi chef in Japan. After watching, I took a week to see what resonated with me, and there are a few topic that stick, related to the nurturing of one&rsquo;s craft. </p>
<p>The themes I latched onto focussed on the conversations about Jiro&rsquo;s craft. He holds steadfast to a strong work ethic, and the notion that perfection can only be achieved through years of rigor, experience, and apprenticeship. </p>
<p>The chef has focussed his life on serving sushi only. Apparently master chefs around the world agree that his minimalist approach and focus have lead to a remarkable depth of flavor that is hard to match. Food writer, Yamamoto, interviewed extensively for the film, sums his work up saying, &ldquo;Ultimate simplicity leads to purity.&rdquo; </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s valuable to notice in this story is the excruciating attention to detail and rigor, especially as told by Jiro&rsquo;s son and apprentice, Yoshikazu, who is to inherit his fathers restaurant. He talks about having talent (taste in this case), and says making a mark depends on how hard you work. </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to be exclusive or elite. The techniques we use are no big secret. It&rsquo;s just about making an effort and repeating the same thing every day.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think in a way, he is selling himself short when he talks about talent, because I get the feeling he is talking about his father, not himself. But there is something in the depth of knowledge that Yoshikazu has acquired that interests me. It&rsquo;s shown in a much simpler manner, as if he is the worker/doer behind the master, but to me this story steals the spotlight. In doing the work, he is completely subservient to and obedient to the discipline and to his teacher. Everything is taken seriously, and rules are stubbornly adhered to. </p>
<p>I like this idea of the acquisition of skill in the pursuit of being perfect, but there&rsquo;s a sense of sadness, doubt, and feeling of inadequacy in Yoshikazu, until the punchline at the end. There are interesting and at times sad stories of parenting or lack of it, cultural and familial responsibility, and the struggle and drive that comes out of necessity and need to survive. Throughout the telling of this story, it felt like the hyper focus and obsession cost dearly in other ways. </p>
<p>I think if anything, I feel humbled by the obsession with craft told in the story. I don&rsquo;t feel compelled to be as extreme in my own pursuit of craft, at the cost of balance and life, but there is something positive in the message about showing up and doing the work that is told so much more completely here than in any clever and terse poster. Definitely worth the watch. </p>

The second is fairly self-explanatory but carries the extra weight of it coming from the guy who invented the very thing that’s letting me type these words out on the internet.</li>

I&rsquo;m honored to be one of the guest speakers, to give a talk on interface sketching. There&rsquo;ll be an awesome cast of speakers including Chris Ackermann, Matt Bango, Brad Frost, Sasha Laundy, Kenneth Reitz, Tomer Sharon, Rob Spectre, Srjdjan Strbanovic. Early bird tickets are now available (save $50).</p></p>

<p>Asbury Agile is a friendly, single track conference for  web professionals and students to gather, share ideas, learn, and connect with their peeps. The event lakes place at Watermark, in Asbury Park, NJ. You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/asburyagile">@asburyagile</a> for event updates.</p>

<p>The video from last year's conference looks like it's a manageable, intimate event that draws a great crowd from the NJ/NYC web development community. I'm excited not only because I grew up in NJ, but I'm also looking forward to chatting with people about interface sketching, and learn from everyone I meet. I  will likely be posting some of my thoughts in a new Sketch section I'm working on for the Konigi wiki. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>I was going through the parts I had highlighted in my Kindle version of Austin Kleon's book, <em><a href="http://www.austinkleon.com/steal/">Steal Like An Artist,</a></em> and I keep thinking of how much I like this quote from musician Jack White, talking about using constraints to stay creative. I think about how much constraints and removal of the unnecessary makes a difference in helping flow in the tools I use as well. </p>
<p>The quote was actually taken from an interview of White that you can watch in the documentary <em>Under Great White Northern Lights</em>. There's an extended except in the Makin' Ads blog <a href="http://makinads.blogspot.com/2010/04/jack-white-on-creativity.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://youtu.be/fDl-if5Du70?t=1m26s">watch a video clip on YouTube here</a>. </p>

<p>I didn't read <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/this-is-all-your-app-is-a-collection-of-tiny-details.html">Jeff Atwood's article about cat feeders</a> right away, because it really is 90% about a cat product. It's also a terrific demonstration of what he's saying above. The first version of the product, a cat feeder, served a core need well enough for him to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisfice</a> with its shortcomings because the net return in time savings and improved quality of life, for him anyway, was absolutely worth it. </p>

<p>Listening to the opinions expressed by customers, obsessing over the details, and getting them right in the design is necessary and hard. But over time, if the points of pain are incrementally addressed and the design improved, the collection of those well-thought-out details embody a better experience. </p>
<p>Get better slowly, but <em>do</em> get better. Suck it up and feel your users' pain. Assure them that you're listening by sweating the details. </p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/jetpens-1.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></p>
<p>People still occasionally ask me if I make the small bound <a href="wireframe-sketch-book-now-available.html">Wireframe Sketchbooks</a>, but I stopped selling them after a few years, and instead just posted <a href="../tools/sketchbooks-diy.html">instructions</a> for how to make your own. I know that few people have the time or interest to do that, so I've been looking at alternatives for them.</p>
<p>A month ago, Brad  from JetPens contacted me to tell me that he started supplying a sketchbook from Maruman that I might like. What I really liked is how closely it resembles the one I made. Some of my Instagram friends have been seeing pics of me using the <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-Inspiration-Notebook-A5-5.8-X-8.3-5-mm-X-5-mm-Graph-70-Sheets/pd/4078">Maruman Mnemosyne Inspiration Notebook</a>, and a few like it as I do. The one I'm using is the A5 (5.8" X 8.3"), which has a 5 mm X 5 mm pale gray lined grid, title line, and 70 perforated sheets.</p>
<p>Below is a photo of the Konigi notebook on the left and the Maruman on the right. The Sharpie is there to give you a sense of scale.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/jetpens-2.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></p>
<p>You can see that the Maruman is the same width, and only 1/4 inch taller. The Maruman paper is smoother paper than the Konigi, and works well with inks. I'm using with a fine Hi-Tec-C and really love the feel of pen and marker on it. The Konigi book had a little tooth/texture because I like to work with soft pencil as well as pen/marker. </p>
<p>I think this is the closest of any notebook I've tried to mine. It meets the same requirements that I had for a sketchbook: small and wire-bound, white sheets with small quadrille, perforated paper, and can ideally be used in landscape orientation. </p>
<p>Thanks to Brad Dowdy for indulging my pen and paper addiction by letting me test and review the Maruman. If you're interested, you can <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-Inspiration-Notebook-A5-5.8-X-8.3-5-mm-X-5-mm-Graph-70-Sheets/pd/4078">check it out here</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/sketchbooks-diy/">Sketchbooks: DIY Instructions</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p class="dek">This is a guide for binding your own sketchbooks. I offer it to you designers, developers, makers, and tinkerers out there who are looking for a way to physically connect to your practice of designing interfaces, or who maybe just want a fun and practical way to get your hands dirty.</p>

<hr />

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <p>I started making my own sketchbooks and pads a few years ago. At the time there weren't many options for interface sketching and storyboarding.</p>
    <p>I began buying different types of notebooks, researching simple bookbinding, taking classes, and prototyping. I wound up liking wirebound books best. You can see pictures of some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/sets/72157613198002989/">notebooks I made</a> and some of the interface design <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/sets/72157613198002989/">sketchbooks I later sold</a> via this site and Amazon.</p>
    <p>The project to sell the sketchbooks was a great learning experience&#8212;one I would highly recommend. I wanted to go through the steps of learning to design something physical, figure out how to get it produced, and learn about the logistics of selling and fulfilling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <p> It was a great experience, and a lot of people put up with the progressive quality improvements in each phase.</p>
    <p>After a few years making and selling my sketchbooks, I stopped. I've had many requests to stock them again, but in the end the time and effort to devote to this business of designing and selling atoms, and improving the product costs more to me than I have to give. I've decided to just tell you how I make mine and give you the printable sheets, links to resources, and the steps to make your own.</p>
    <p>The easiest method for binding your own sketchbooks would be to take paper (either plain white, or <a href="graph-paper.html">printable graphpaper</a>) to your local copy shop and have them wirebind your pages together. The suggestions below might help if you want to invest in a binding machine and do it yourself like I do.</p>

    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <p>I use a wire binding machine to do all of my own personal sketchbooks, using the double-ring style binding closure, also called wire-o or twin-loop. I prefer this style of binding because it lays flat, and the cover can be folded back on itself to make it easy to keep a small book on your lap or desk.</p>
    <p>The machine in the pictures on the top right of this page is the <a href="http://akiles.com/product_select.php?&amp;category_id=1">Akiles Wiremac Duo</a>. It's not inexpensive, but it gave me the most flexibility when it came to binding both large and small books. It's heavy and has a 16" x 17" footprint, but it's made to work hard and last a long time. I've bound hundreds of books with this one and it still works like new.</p>
    <p>At the lowest end is an inexpensive little craft product called the <a href="http://binditall.com/Products.html">Bind it All</a> that makes mini-wirebound books, but you can also shift the paper along the binder to bind bigger books.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- col2 -->
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>Decide on the kind of sketchbook you're going to make.</strong> </p>
    <p>Here are some things to figure out.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What size? Letter (8.5" x 11"), half letter (8.5" x 5.5"), A5?</li>
    <li>What orientation? Portrait bound on the long side or landscape bound on the short?</li>
    <li>How many pages? Number of pages determines the coil size to buy.</li>
    <li>Elastic enclosure? If yes, you'll need a way to attach them.</li>
    <li>Envelope or pocket in the back? If you use eyelets to attach, they'll interfere with the back pages. Envelopes or pockets prevent this from happening. Envelopes are easier because they can be bound with the back cover. Pockets need to be glued on.</li>
</ul>
  </div>
  <!-- col3 -->
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <p>Shop around. There may be more affordable sources out there than what I've used.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Heavy stock/chipboard for front and back cover. MyBinding sells them in <a href="http://www.mybinding.com/.sc/ms/dd/ee/51376/8.5-x-11-Letter-Size-24pt-Chipboard-Covers-25pk">letter size</a>.</li>
    <li>Paper (blank, <a href="graph-paper.html">graphpaper</a>, whatever)</li>
    <li>Wire-O coils</li>
    <li>Envelope or Pocket stock (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4" elastic, eyelets, eyelet puncher, wooden mallet, anvil, eyelet closing tool  (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I got my binding materials from the <a href="https://www.probinding.com/">ProBinding</a> and My Binding sites. The Eyelets and hardware for snap closures came from <a href="http://www.seattlefabrics.com/gromsnap.html">Seattle Fabrics</a>. The elastic came from <a href="http://www.createforless.com/">Create for Less</a>.</p>

<h3 class="tcenter">Binding</h3>

<p>This tutorial shows you exactly how I bind books with the wire-binding machine. What you end up doing will depend on the machine you choose, but the steps should be about the same. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>1. Measure</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Measure stack of paper, front cover and back cover against the binder's coil guide. This will tell you what size coil to use. I typically create 50-60 page notebooks with a 3/4" 2:1 coil.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>2. Hang your coils</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Hang your coils on the coil holder on the front of the binder.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>3. Punch envelope</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/3.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Punch envelope first and place with front of envelope facing forward.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>4. Punch paper</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/4.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Punch paper in sets and place on coils, repeat until all placed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>5. Punch front cover</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/5.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Punch front cover and place on coils, with front of cover facing forward.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>6. Punch back cover</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/6.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Punch back cover and place on coils, with inside facing forward.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>7. Cut coils</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/7.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p> Cut coils to end of book edge.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>8. Close coils</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/8.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Pull the stack off of the binder, and rest with open coil side down on the coil squeezer. Pull lever to close coils.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>9. Flip over & enjoy</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/9.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Flip over the back cover. You'll notice that because you hung the envelope and paper first, the inwardly-turned part of the coil should keep paper from sliding out of the rings.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr />

<h3 class="tcenter">Attaching elastic closure (optional)</h3>

<div class="row tutorial">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>1. Punch back cover</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/10.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Create a cardboard rig to place your eyelets evenly on the back and use a clamp or bulldog clips to hold the cover and jig together. Use your punch and mallet to punch two holes at the corners about 1" in from each side. The wooden mallet works well with a small anvil.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>2. Insert elastic & eyelet</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/11.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Cut 1/4" elastic bands. I measure to the length of the edge of book that will be wrapped and add 2-3 inches for the books above. Thread the elastic through your holes and leave 1/2" hanging on the inside. Push the eyelets through the holes, outside facing the back.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <h4>3. Close eyelets</h4>
    <img src="http://media.konigi.com/tools/sketchbooks-diy/12.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p>Use your eyelet crimping tool to snap closed the open end and fasten the elastic to the back cover. Make sure you're using the right end of the eyelet tool or else they won't close properly and cleanly. You can now cut that excess 1/2" of elastic from the inside back cover.</p>
  </div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <p>Big costly binders aren't your only option. At right are pics of books I've bound with a DIY disk-binding system. They have sort of a cult following among notebook and journal obsessives because of their versatility.</p>
    <p>Disk systems let you punch small mushroom shaped holes in your paper that you slide into disks (some people call these Smurf binders because of the shape). This lets you easily remove and replace pages in your books. Nice, right?</p>
    <p>To the right are a few vendors that sell disk binding systems.</p>

<h3 class="tcenter">Sketchpads</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <p>Sketchpads are made by gluing stacks of paper that on one end. To make sketchpads, you'll need a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=padding+press">padding press</a>, paper, chipboard, and padding compound. These are easily obtained from office and binding supply stores.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-4">
    <p>Tim Liston pointed me to an inexpensive wooden binder called the <a href="http://www.paddingpressmagic.com/">Pad Magic Paper Padding Press</a> that looks decent for DIYers doing small runs. The free <a href="graph-paper.html">printable graphpaper</a> sheets on this site are perfect for this.

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/give-it-five-minutes/">Give it five minutes</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>I'm certainly no stranger to being opinionated and argumentative. I've put my foot in my mouth a few times by pushing back on others' ideas, and am well aware that being quick to react can be detrimental. The older I get, the more I realize how little I know and how much more time I need to spend thinking after listening, before I open my mouth or start to type to respond.</p>

<p>I admire Jason Fried's recent blog post, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">&quot;Give it five minutes.&quot;</a> In it, he writes candidly about the issue of pushing back on ideas, starting from an exchange he had with Richard Saul Wurman, where the two had given talks at the same event. Wurman approached Fried to congratulate him, and Fried replied by telling Wurman what he disagreed with about his talk. The take away from that exchange was that Wurman taught Fried to stop and think, to give ideas a chance before challenging them with little respect or consideration.</p>

<p>I like this bit of advice from Fried, who turned that lesson into an opportunity to grow personally, and share what he learned from that exchange.</p>

<p><blockquote>There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.</p>

<p>Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.</p>

<p>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.</blockquote></p>

<p>There's a fantastic little Jonathan Ive anecdote in there as well, where Ive explains Steve Jobs' respect for the fragility of ideas, the best of which can start out naive, but lead to beautiful things if they're allowed the time and space to be explored.</p>

<p>While some of the best products can grow out of one's work done in isolation, the ideas need to be shared to grow into products. Stifling others' ideas with immediate push back is not only a quick way to alienate your team, but squashing them too early can really do the most harm to you, by depriving you from seeing what it might become. This is one of those rare reminders that with maturity, hopefully we can learn to become more humble and grow. We just have to be open to the ideas.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="screenshot center"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/teddyhaters.gif" class="center" /></div>
<p><span class="dek">It&rsquo;s the doers who do. </span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never read Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic">Citizenship in a Republic/Man in the Arena</a>&rdquo; speech before hearing it in this <a href="http://blip.tv/business-of-software/business-of-software-2011-what-happened-the-short-version-5960533">BoS2011</a> recap video. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing him with his pince nez saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the critic who counts,&rdquo; and thinking, even Roosevelt agrees, &ldquo;haters gonna hate.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s a good reminder to every one of us showing up every day, trying, failing, and succeeding, despite the obstacles, critics, haters, etc. But don&rsquo;t take it from me. Teddy told you so.</p></p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/you-can-now-post-mockups-uxstackexchangecom/">You can now post Mockups to UX.StackExchange.com</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4f4b9c9c3be5c_large.jpg"/></a></div><p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited about the announcement we at Balsamiq were able to make jointly with the group at StackExchange today. The two groups have been working together to integrate Mockups into the UX StackExchange.  You can now post Mockups wireframes with questions and answers to <a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/">UX.StackExchange.com</a> using the free integrated Mockups editor. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about this. One of the conversations Peldi and I had before I joined Balsamiq was about creating something I&rsquo;ve wanted to use for a long time&ndash;a site where you could upload wireframes to vet ideas, get feedback, and test concepts with other peer professionals. I&rsquo;m of the &ldquo;show me, don&rsquo;t tell me&rdquo; school of communication. Luckily the excellent UX version of StackExchange was created, and Mockups had the plugin model to integrate with it nicely, so lazyweb wishes can happen without even asking. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a bit from <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2012/02/27/uxstackexchange/">our announcement</a> at Balsamiq:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t know what <a href="http://www.stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> is, you&rsquo;ve been missing out. It&rsquo;s a collection of community-edited and moderated question and answer websites, each dedicated to becoming the single best online resource on a number of different topics. The most famous StackExchange site is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow.com</a>, the ultimate Q&amp;A site for programming questions. Other popular StackExchange sites are <a href="http://startups.stackexchange.com/">Startups.StackExchange.com</a> or <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/">English.StackExchange.com</a>, about the English Language and its Usage. See a full list <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">here</a>.</p>
<p>About a month ago we were excited to see that <a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/">UX.StackExchange.com</a> launched publicly, and thanks to the long beta period had already become a wonderful resource for anyone interested in creating better software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some users had been posting Mockups to the site, and finally user Moshe Berman posted <a href="http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/647/can-stackexchange-license-balsamiq-for-mockups-on-ux-stackexchange">this question</a> asking if the site could license Mockups. Peldi got a message from Joel Spolsky, the two groups iterated on ideas in myBalsamiq, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>You can find out more about how to <a href="http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2012/02/27/uxstackexchange/">use Mockups in the UX StackExchange</a> in our blog and in <a href="http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/647/can-stackexchange-license-balsamiq-for-mockups-on-ux-stackexchange/781#781">this thread on UX.SE</a>.</p></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="video">
<iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/800798301/realizing-empathy-an-inquiry-into-the-meaning-of-m/widget/video.html" width="480px"></iframe>

<p>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn&rsquo;t understand. He went to art school.</p>
<p>Slim&rsquo;s book explores how making works (as a process), what it means (to make something), and why it matters (to our lives). Through this exploration the book also investigates the ethics of our relationship to Computer Technology, and proposes a new direction.</p>
<p>I love the idea of learning something new and unfamiliar as a way of expanding one&rsquo;s perspective. Two of my favorite articles/talks in recent years that relate to this topic are <a href="bill-buxton-how-keep-innovating.html">Bill Buxton&rsquo;s article on how to keep innovating</a> and <a href="paula-scher-gets-serious-ted.html">Paula Scher&rsquo;s Ted Talk on finding fun in the unfamiliar.</a></p>
<p>Judging by the introduction video, the book looks to be substantial, exploratory, humble, and inspiring. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to reading it. </p>
<p>The book is being funded now, so if you want to see it happen like I do, you can <a href="http://kck.st/whvn03">back this project on Kickstarter</a>. </p></p>
