Every build and iteration requires review and circling back to evaluate the component in terms of the need identified in the use case scenario. Put into action, he says:<br>How do we integrate the components back into a context for review? Ask the question: “What is the user trying to do here?” The job the user has in mind is the best integration point because the user’s mind doesn’t tidily follow the boundaries of implementation.</li><li><a href=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665022/why-does-interaction-design-matter-lets-look-at-the-evolving-subway-experience class=ttl>Why Does Interaction Design Matter?

The group meets frequently, literally sitting around a kitchen table, to debate all products under development. “We’ll sit there with our sketch books and trade ideas,” Stringer said, appearing as the first witness in the Apple vs. Samsung trial. “That’s where the really hard, brutal honest criticism comes in.”<br>From there, the group puts the sketches into a computer-aided design program and, if warranted, creates a physical model. “Our role is to imagine products that don’t exist and guide them to life,” Stringer said. There could be 50 designs for a single button, he added. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said."</li></ul></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Saturday, Aug 25, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/link-drop>link drop</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/pace/>Pace</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/><img src=//konigi.com/media/bluga/wt503901bbde9e1_large.jpg></a></div><p>Hannah Donovan's <a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/>essay in A List Apart</a> considers the issue of pace of delivery of information in web products. In a world where information is streamed constantly to us if we allow it, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable. Context, medium, and place of use are important factors for determining delivery and pace.</p><p>I've been interested in the slow movement in recent years, as it relates to sustainable living, slow design, slow food, and the 1K Movement. In the summer of 2011, I was fortunate enough to experience a very special meal on a very small farm/restaurant in Italy's Le Marche region. All the food and drink prepared is grown on the farm or sourced hyper-locally, from meat and vegetables, to wine—everything within 1 kilometer. It was the most profound eating experience of my life. Little bits and pieces of that day have made me think about how my approach to work and life have become more and more connected to each other, and how much of an impact one's production and consumption decisions have on the world.</p><p>From a design and lifestyle perspective, I like to reference this summary of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Movement>philosophy of the Slow Movement</a> by Professor Guttorm Fløistad, found on Wikipedia:</p><p><blockquote>The only thing for certain is that everything changes. The rate of change increases. If you want to hang on you better speed up. That is the message of today. It could however be useful to remind everyone that <strong>our basic needs never change</strong>. The need to be seen and appreciated! It is the need to belong. The need for nearness and care, and for a little love! This is given only through slowness in human relations. In order to master changes, we have to recover slowness, reflection and togetherness. There we will find real renewal.</blockquote></p><p>It's a bit touchy-feely, and lives entirely in the center of Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. But the idea of taking a holistic approach to fulfilling needs in all things, provides the basis for actually satisfying them in other ways up the triangle. Specifically, I'm thinking of the idea of fulfilling the needs for esteem and self-actualization as one example. In a scenario where speed and volume has become the norm, how has that situation impacted our lives?</p><p>I like how Donovan tells the story of learning from the experience at <a href=http://last.fm/>Last.fm</a> to imagine <a href=http://www.thisismyjam.com/>This is My Jam</a>, a product that goes the other way, and focuses on the quality and value of the experience, using pace as the point of pivot. I like this approach. I have mostly stopped consuming from the firehose, and seek out the products that deliver a signal that I get more value from, more satisfaction, or that fulfill my basic needs with less fluff and noise. The decision to work with a product and team that follows those ideals is important to me as well.</p><p>Beth Meredith and Eric Storm <a href=http://www.create-the-good-life.com/slow_design.html>summarize the concept of Slow Design</a>.</p><p><blockquote>Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.</blockquote></p><p>The Slow Movement is not just a lifestyle choice, but as designers, we can choose to have an impact on the world based on these ideals.</p><p><a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/><a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/>http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Saturday, Aug 25, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/data>data</a></li><li><a href=/tags/information-work>information work</a></li><li><a href=/tags/must-read>must read</a></li><li><a href=/tags/needs>needs</a></li><li><a href=/tags/psychology>psychology</a></li><li><a href=/tags/slow-movement>slow movement</a></li><li><a href=/tags/social-software>social software</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/link-drop-week-33-2012/>Link Drop (week 33 of 2012)</a></h2><section class=article-body><pre><code>      &lt;ul class=&quot;ld&quot;&gt;

There are some serious side effects to their hidden save as, by the way, as this post notes, resulting in the need to use the Revert To... feature, a technique also referred to as &quot;unfucking.&quot; All of this only makes me think of people who use the term &quot;unfuckingbelievable&quot; in moments of crisis and disbelief.  It's never easy to remove from an interface, but at this level of use, it is is bold and not at all unbelievable.&lt;/li&gt;

I've been on a documentary kick lately, and this has made it into the category of films I'd re-watch.</p><p>The film looks at the life of celebrated sushi chef, Jiro Ono, whose small restaurant serves only sushi and requires a reservation 3 months in advance, and who is regarded as the most masterful sushi chef in Japan. After watching, I took a week to see what resonated with me, and there are a few topic that stick, related to the nurturing of one's craft.</p><p>The themes I latched onto focussed on the conversations about Jiro's craft. He holds steadfast to a strong work ethic, and the notion that perfection can only be achieved through years of rigor, experience, and apprenticeship.</p><p>The chef has focussed his life on serving sushi only. Apparently master chefs around the world agree that his minimalist approach and focus have lead to a remarkable depth of flavor that is hard to match. Food writer, Yamamoto, interviewed extensively for the film, sums his work up saying, "Ultimate simplicity leads to purity."</p><p>What's valuable to notice in this story is the excruciating attention to detail and rigor, especially as told by Jiro's son and apprentice, Yoshikazu, who is to inherit his fathers restaurant. He talks about having talent (taste in this case), and says making a mark depends on how hard you work.</p><blockquote><p>"We're not trying to be exclusive or elite. The techniques we use are no big secret. It's just about making an effort and repeating the same thing every day."</p></blockquote><p>I think in a way, he is selling himself short when he talks about talent, because I get the feeling he is talking about his father, not himself. But there is something in the depth of knowledge that Yoshikazu has acquired that interests me. It's shown in a much simpler manner, as if he is the worker/doer behind the master, but to me this story steals the spotlight. In doing the work, he is completely subservient to and obedient to the discipline and to his teacher. Everything is taken seriously, and rules are stubbornly adhered to.</p><p>I like this idea of the acquisition of skill in the pursuit of being perfect, but there's a sense of sadness, doubt, and feeling of inadequacy in Yoshikazu, until the punchline at the end. There are interesting and at times sad stories of parenting or lack of it, cultural and familial responsibility, and the struggle and drive that comes out of necessity and need to survive. Throughout the telling of this story, it felt like the hyper focus and obsession cost dearly in other ways.</p><p>I think if anything, I feel humbled by the obsession with craft told in the story. I don't feel compelled to be as extreme in my own pursuit of craft, at the cost of balance and life, but there is something positive in the message about showing up and doing the work that is told so much more completely here than in any clever and terse poster. Definitely worth the watch.</p><p><small>Via <a href=http://www.90percentofeverything.com/>Harry Brignull</a></small></p><p><a href=http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/><a href=http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/>http://www.magpictures.com/jirodreamsofsushi/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Tuesday, Aug 14, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/craft>craft</a></li><li><a href=/tags/film>film</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/link-drop-week-32-2012/>Link Drop (week 32 of 2012)</a></h2><section class=article-body><ul class=ld><li><a href=http://joelrunyon.com/two3/an-unexpected-ass-kicking class=ttl>An Unexpected Ass Kicking</a> Great post by Joel Runyon, who talks about getting schooled by Russel Kirsch. 2 takeaways: 1) Nothing is withheld from us which we have conceived to do. 2) Do things that have never been done.

I'm honored to be one of the guest speakers, to give a talk on interface sketching. There'll be an awesome cast of speakers including Chris Ackermann, Matt Bango, Brad Frost, Sasha Laundy, Kenneth Reitz, Tomer Sharon, Rob Spectre, Srjdjan Strbanovic. Early bird tickets are now available (save $50).</p><p>Asbury Agile is a friendly, single track conference for web professionals and students to gather, share ideas, learn, and connect with their peeps. The event lakes place at Watermark, in Asbury Park, NJ. You can follow <a href=https://twitter.com/asburyagile>@asburyagile</a> for event updates.</p><p>The video from last year's conference looks like it's a manageable, intimate event that draws a great crowd from the NJ/NYC web development community. I'm excited not only because I grew up in NJ, but I'm also looking forward to chatting with people about interface sketching, and learn from everyone I meet. I will likely be posting some of my thoughts in a new Sketch section I'm working on for the Konigi wiki.

I know that few people have the time or interest to do that, so I've been looking at alternatives for them.</p><p>A month ago, Brad from JetPens contacted me to tell me that he started supplying a sketchbook from Maruman that I might like. What I really liked is how closely it resembles the one I made. Some of my Instagram friends have been seeing pics of me using the <a href=http://www.jetpens.com/Maruman-Mnemosyne-Inspiration-Notebook-A5-5.8-X-8.3-5-mm-X-5-mm-Graph-70-Sheets/pd/4078>Maruman Mnemosyne Inspiration Notebook</a>, and a few like it as I do.

The Sharpie is there to give you a sense of scale.</p><p><img src=//konigi.com/media/notebook/jetpens-2.jpg class=notebook-image></p><p>You can see that the Maruman is the same width, and only 1/4 inch taller. The Maruman paper is smoother paper than the Konigi, and works well with inks. I'm using with a fine Hi-Tec-C and really love the feel of pen and marker on it. The Konigi book had a little tooth/texture because I like to work with soft pencil as well as pen/marker.</p><p>I think this is the closest of any notebook I've tried to mine. It meets the same requirements that I had for a sketchbook: small and wire-bound, white sheets with small quadrille, perforated paper, and can ideally be used in landscape orientation.</p><p>Thanks to Brad Dowdy for indulging my pen and paper addiction by letting me test and review the Maruman.

Wurman approached Fried to congratulate him, and Fried replied by telling Wurman what he disagreed with about his talk. The take away from that exchange was that Wurman taught Fried to stop and think, to give ideas a chance before challenging them with little respect or consideration.</p><p>I like this bit of advice from Fried, who turned that lesson into an opportunity to grow personally, and share what he learned from that exchange.</p><p><blockquote>There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people’s money and 2. Dismissing an idea.</p><p>Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn’t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That’s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.</p><p>So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it’s too hard or it’s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.</blockquote></p><p>There's a fantastic little Jonathan Ive anecdote in there as well, where Ive explains Steve Jobs' respect for the fragility of ideas, the best of which can start out naive, but lead to beautiful things if they're allowed the time and space to be explored.</p><p>While some of the best products can grow out of one's work done in isolation, the ideas need to be shared to grow into products. Stifling others' ideas with immediate push back is not only a quick way to alienate your team, but squashing them too early can really do the most harm to you, by depriving you from seeing what it might become. This is one of those rare reminders that with maturity, hopefully we can learn to become more humble and grow. We just have to be open to the ideas.</p><p><a href=http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes><a href=http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes>http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Friday, Mar 2, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/communication>communication</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ideas>ideas</a></li><li><a href=/tags/ideation>ideation</a></li><li><a href=/tags/professional-development>professional development</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/teddy-on-haters/>Teddy on haters</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class="screenshot center"><img src=//konigi.com/media/notebook/teddyhaters.gif class=center></div><p><span class=dek>It's the doers who do.</span></p><p>I've never read Theodore Roosevelt's "<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic>Citizenship in a Republic/Man in the Arena</a>" speech before hearing it in this <a href=http://blip.tv/business-of-software/business-of-software-2011-what-happened-the-short-version-5960533>BoS2011</a> recap video.</p><p>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."</p><p>I'm seeing him with his pince nez saying, "It's not the critic who counts," and thinking, even Roosevelt agrees, "haters gonna hate." I think that's a good reminder to every one of us showing up every day, trying, failing, and succeeding, despite the obstacles, critics, haters, etc. But don't take it from me. Teddy told you so.</p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Friday, Mar 2, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/quotes>quotes</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/you-can-now-post-mockups-uxstackexchangecom/>You can now post Mockups to UX.StackExchange.com</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=notebook-screenshot><a href=http://ux.stackexchange.com/><img src=//konigi.com/media/bluga/wt4f4b9c9c3be5c_large.jpg></a></div><p>I'm pretty excited about the announcement we at Balsamiq were able to make jointly with the group at StackExchange today. The two groups have been working together to integrate Mockups into the UX StackExchange. You can now post Mockups wireframes with questions and answers to <a href=http://ux.stackexchange.com/>UX.StackExchange.com</a> using the free integrated Mockups editor.</p><p>I'm really excited about this. One of the conversations Peldi and I had before I joined Balsamiq was about creating something I've wanted to use for a long time--a site where you could upload wireframes to vet ideas, get feedback, and test concepts with other peer professionals. I'm of the "show me, don't tell me" school of communication. Luckily the excellent UX version of StackExchange was created, and Mockups had the plugin model to integrate with it nicely, so lazyweb wishes can happen without even asking.</p><p>Here's a bit from <a href=http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2012/02/27/uxstackexchange/>our announcement</a> at Balsamiq:</p><blockquote><p>If you don't know what <a href=http://www.stackexchange.com/>StackExchange</a> is, you've been missing out. It's a collection of community-edited and moderated question and answer websites, each dedicated to becoming the single best online resource on a number of different topics. The most famous StackExchange site is <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/>StackOverflow.com</a>, the ultimate Q&A site for programming questions. Other popular StackExchange sites are <a href=http://startups.stackexchange.com/>Startups.StackExchange.com</a> or <a href=http://english.stackexchange.com/>English.StackExchange.com</a>, about the English Language and its Usage. See a full list <a href=http://stackexchange.com/sites>here</a>.</p><p>About a month ago we were excited to see that <a href=http://ux.stackexchange.com/>UX.StackExchange.com</a> launched publicly, and thanks to the long beta period had already become a wonderful resource for anyone interested in creating better software.</p></blockquote><p>Some users had been posting Mockups to the site, and finally user Moshe Berman posted <a href=http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/647/can-stackexchange-license-balsamiq-for-mockups-on-ux-stackexchange>this question</a> asking if the site could license Mockups. Peldi got a message from Joel Spolsky, the two groups iterated on ideas in myBalsamiq, and the rest is history.</p><p>You can find out more about how to <a href=http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/2012/02/27/uxstackexchange/>use Mockups in the UX StackExchange</a> in our blog and in <a href=http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com/questions/647/can-stackexchange-license-balsamiq-for-mockups-on-ux-stackexchange/781#781>this thread on UX.SE</a>.</p><p><a href=http://ux.stackexchange.com/><a href=http://ux.stackexchange.com/>http://ux.stackexchange.com/</a></a></p></section><section class="metadata single bottom"><div class=pub-date>Published on Monday, Feb 27, 2012 in <a href=/blog class=capitalize>blog</a></div><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/community>community</a></li><li><a href=/tags/wireframing>wireframing</a></li></ul></section></article><article><h2 class=post-title><a href=https://konigi.com/blog/realizing-empathy-inquiry-meaning-making/>Realizing Empathy: An Inquiry into the Meaning of Making</a></h2><section class=article-body><div class=video><iframe frameborder=0 height=360px src=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/800798301/realizing-empathy-an-inquiry-into-the-meaning-of-m/widget/video.html width=480px></iframe></div><p>Seung Chan Lim, better known as Slim, spent 10 years making software, working in computer science and interaction design at MAYA Design where he was the Assistant Director of Engineering. After some soul searching he began to ask why he was doing what he was doing, and at the suggestion of a mentor, he went out to do something different, something he didn't understand. He went to art school.</p><p>Slim's book explores how making works (as a process), what it means (to make something), and why it matters (to our lives). Through this exploration the book also investigates the ethics of our relationship to Computer Technology, and proposes a new direction.</p><p>I love the idea of learning something new and unfamiliar as a way of expanding one's perspective.
