    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/articles/power/design-with-intent.html"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a3fa566cf438_0.jpg"/></a></div><p>I enjoyed reading two excellent articles in a dialogue about design with intent&#8212;the practice of strategically designing to influencing user behavior&#8212;and how user centered design process fits or is at oods with the designer&rsquo;s desire to influence. The first is Robert Fabricant&rsquo;s article on <a href="http://designmind.frogdesign.com/articles/power/design-with-intent.html">&ldquo;Design with Intent: how designers can influence behavior&rdquo;</a>, and the follow up is Dan Lockton&rsquo;s <a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk/2009/06/14/frog-design-on-design-with-intent/">&ldquo;frog design on Design with Intent&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>User centered design focuses primarily on user needs and  research and decision making must support these needs. Because of this, the argument being made by Frog Design&rsquo;s Robert Fabricant is that UCD puts designers a step removed from playing an active role in influencing behavior in ways reflective of their own values and judgement, and the desire to engage more directly has led designers to push outside of the boundaries of the purist&rsquo;s definition of UCD practice. </p>
<p>In a typical UCD designed product, the designer tends to disappear and the user&rsquo;s engagement with the designed product or experience is judged by the essence of understanding and predictability of need intrinsic in the product design&#8212;to me the essence is the ability to allow frictionless or enjoyable use, made possible by the design and designer. Fabricant wrote that designers want to have more of an active and immediate role in behavior change through social engagement, and are doing so in more apparent ways. This is taking shape through direct engagement with users through practices intended to influence their behavior positively. The three mentioned themes in play are Persuasion Design, Catalyst Design, and Performance Design. Catalyst and Performance Design are new terms to me, but the concepts and some of the examples of participatory design, more direct involvement with users, or providing open architectures for user involvement with design on web products are familiar.</p>
<p>Dan Lockton, author of the Design With Intent site, writes that the notion of &ldquo;direct behavior design&rdquo; is something often perceived along the lines of architectural determinism or behaviorism, and warns that awareness that someone is trying to determine and influence your behavior often leads to an emotional reactance&#8212;the very idea that one&rsquo;s freedom is being restricted or one&rsquo;s behavior being persuasively pushed in some direction causes irritation. He also says that while Fabricant believes design with intent may be opposed to the principles of the user centered design philosophy, it needn&rsquo;t be viewed this way. To quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would argue that in cases where design with intent, or design for behaviour change, is aligned with what the user wants to achieve, it’s very much still user-centred design, whether enabling, motivating or constraining. It’s the best form of user-centred design, supporting a user’s goals while transforming his or her behaviour. Some of the most insightful current work on influencing user behaviour &hellip; starts with achieving a deeper understanding of user behaviour with existing products and systems, to identify better how to improve the design.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the argument could be made that somewhere in the process of injecting the designer into the users&rsquo; experience, especially in the more apparent and active examples of Catalyst Design and Performance Design, that the approach to engaging with users is entirely more active and immersed in users&rsquo; awareness than what I&rsquo;ve ever understood User Centered Design to encompass. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me in the end, whether this expanding role of the designer from designing for use, to influencing behavior is contrary to any given process. What matters to me is where you see the lines of responsibility, and how easily you can cross them for the users&rsquo; benefit while doing no harm. A more engaged designer needn&rsquo;t be on the &ldquo;genius designer&rdquo; end of the spectrum to have to believe that they might provide a needed role by influencing new or different behavior that helps achieve user goals, for instance, rather than perpetuating existing models.</p></p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/why-browser-zoom-shouldnt-kill-flexible-layouts/">Why browser zoom shouldn&#39;t kill flexible layouts</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://zomigi.com/blog/why-browser-zoom-shouldnt-kill-flexible-layouts/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4a3b8efa6d85f_0.jpg"/></a></div><p>Zoe Mickley Gillenwater posted <a href="http://zomigi.com/blog/why-browser-zoom-shouldnt-kill-flexible-layouts/"> an interesting article</a> which makes the argument that browser zoom doesn&rsquo;t obviate the utility of flexible (liquid and elastic) layouts. The argument is apparently being made that because of browser zoom, flexible layouts aren&rsquo;t necessary. But in fact, web designers that have fixed layouts know that the default zoom behavior on fixed layouts causes horizontal scrollbars. The fix is to use &ldquo;Zoom text only&rdquo; options, e.g. in Firefox and Safari 4.</p>
<p>Gillenwater makes the argument that in either use of browser zoom&#8212;normal zoom or text only zoom&#8212;flexible layouts not only give users control, but they also tend not to break and show horiztonal scrollbars. I move between both worlds. On this site, I use fixed widths with flexible em-based type that works well with Zoom Text Only. It&rsquo;s a decision I make knowing that it affects the smaller population that want to use a narrow viewport. But on the enterprise web software I&rsquo;ve done front end development on, I use flexible layouts because of the audience and use. In those cases, designing for smaller laptop and netbooks, as well as mobile devices is a necessity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting discussion, and brings up issues to be aware of. In many scenarios, I imagine a large majority of users won&rsquo;t use browser zoom, and those that do will be the most likely to be aware of the difference of zooming the entire page versus zooming only text. Knowing your audience and choosing a strategy that&rsquo;s appropriate is the expected advice, but also knowing how to make the most of the capabilities of zoom while attempting to prevent breakage is what this is about to me. I don&rsquo;t intend to make this incarnation of Konigi, for instance, liquid or elastic, but I try to make type work when zoom is modified. Whereas other scenarios I could imagine for this site, e.g. a web app perhaps, might demand flexible layouts.</p></p>

Their <a href="http://b.lesseverything.com/2009/5/22/ui-testing-results-for-lessaccounting-com">first test</a> modified the design of 2 buttons (see tour, try), using 1 button instead for the &ldquo;Try Less Accounting&rdquo; link and a text link for &ldquo;See Tour&rdquo;. They noticed a small increase in conversion when they went to the single button, and then did a <a href="http://b.lesseverything.com/">second test</a>, reversing the position of the button and link. </p>
<p>Minor tweaks like these create small increases in coversions, but if the number of users is large, this could mean a significant difference in revenue. It&rsquo;s cool that they&rsquo;re so transparent about the design tweaks they&rsquo;re experimenting with.</p></p>

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://core77.com/blog/book_reviews/book_review_sketchbook_conceptual_drawings_from_the_worlds_most_influential_designers_by_timothy_odonnell_13737.asp"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/notebook/sketchbook-review.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Core77 reviews Timothy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s <em>Sketchbook</em>, which looks at the problem solving processes of influential designers on finished projects through the lens of their sketchbooks. It looks beautiful. </p>
<p><blockquoute>Organized in three sections, &ldquo;Rough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refined,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Random&rdquo; (plus bonus section &ldquo;Revealed,&rdquo; where O&rsquo;Donnell shows the thumbnail sketches he used to lay out the book), almost all sketches/sketchbook pages are pared with pictures of the finished product side by side. The &ldquo;Rough&rdquo; section features loose artwork and thick lines, but crisp final products, like the way Jason Munn turns simple sketches into iconic music posters, while the &ldquo;Refined&rdquo; section sees Stefan Bucher&rsquo;s gorgeous pens turned into, well, equally iconic logos and business cards. Beyond nearly academic distinctions about the roughness of lines, the &ldquo;Rough&rdquo; and &ldquo;Refined&rdquo; sections are nearly indistinguishable. Once again, it seems that the graphic designers capable of hand drawing typography consistently generate the prettiest sketchbooks. Chris Bigg&rsquo;s felt pen album covers fill the stark pages with high contrast imagery and Rob O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s album covers are nearly as stimulating in ideation as they are as finished products. Perhaps it&rsquo;s no surprise that graphic designers produce the prettiest sketchbooks, but it the tight confines of typography often generate the quickest and most inspirational sketches as well.</blockquoute></p>
