  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/konigi-wants-grow/">Konigi Wants to Grow</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>I'm going to be tearing things up a little while Konigi gets a clue about what it is. I started playing with this blog in Nov 07 as a more organized way of doing my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/sets/72157600094498222/">visual design</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/designpatterns/">user interface design</a> sets on Flickr, and think it's still going well. But over time I've found myself drawn to re-blogging and writing the occasional essay, reminding me of my first try at blogging when I did iaslash. And then the old sketchbooks full of ideas that came out of all those great conversations with IAI peeps in Monterrey and my iaslash readers kept returning, and I found myself wanting to find time to work on some micro-projects to build IA/IXD tools.</p>
<p>It's been a little over a year since I started announced Konigi, and it feels like time to take this site a bit more seriously and use it as a platform for other kinds of the learning, sharing, and collection of resources that I've wanted to do for some time. Konigi wants to be better and do more with its life. So I'm going to start with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/3344620893/">a few little design tweaks</a> and evolve the site organically as time becomes available to help this baby along. </p>
<p>So what's coming? I have a series of instructional essays that I've outlined and have started writing. I have a wonderful new community project planned that that will be possible through Peldi Guilizzoni, the gracious and talented creator of <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products">Balsamiq</a>. And I'm going to play at opening up the site a little more until stuff gets broken. The Modus Operandi will be to just do stuff rather than doing so much thinking and talking, to do it wrong, to fail, to have people mock me, and be left standing at the end. As always, I plan to give away some stuff, charge a little for other stuff, and push a few smallish projects forward with the help of friends to fill gaps where we need educational/learning resources.</p>
<p>Finally, I personally want to do more and contribute more outside of this community, and I'm hoping to find a way to give away more to people in need. The sale of things on this site has really taken me by surprise and now I want to do something better and more meaningful if I'm in a position to do so. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do, but when the idea begins to take shape I'll let you know what that's all about. </p>
<p>So onward. Grow up little, Konigi. Make something of yourself.</p>

The first 3 parts are up now.</p>
<blockquote><p>After designing several large enterprise applications for diverse clients and industries, Iâ€™ve noticed some barriers to crafting a great experience in Flex. I think these barriers arise from the relative newness of the technology (and RIAs in general), the initial focus on development over design, and the confidence that Flex can provide a great UX out of the box. But it takes a bit more to make a Flex app really shine. Fortunately, the Flex community is chock-full of talented and motivated developers who contribute amazing resources.</p></blockquote>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/schedule-and-cost-summary-calculator/">Schedule and Cost Summary Calculator</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><div class="row">
  <div class="columns small-12 medium-8">
    <h3>About this template</h3>
    <p>This Cost Estimate and Scheduling spreadsheet provides a lightweight method for learning to estimate time to complete a web design project, and calculating cost for completion. The intended audience is individual freelancers or contractors who need to prepare proposals for potential clients. This may not be an ideal format for the calculation of project team estimates. </p>
    <p>The purpose of the document is to teach you to get acquainted with spreadsheets as tools for cost estimation, with the hopes that you will learn to use and modify it to suit your needs. Please note that this is only meant to be learning a tool and must be customized to be useful to you. This is NOT meant to be an out of the box solution.</p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>This spreadsheet works by breaking your phases into individual tasks. You estimate time to complete tasks and start dates. Estimates are rolled up to show the sum of hours and estimated completion date for all tasks in a phase. Those numbers are then rolled up to show the sum of hours, cost, and completion date for all of the phases. This makes up your cost summary for your proposal. </p>
    <h3>Calculating time</h3>
    <p>The spreadsheet calculates time to complete each task based on an estimated low and high number of hours for each task in each phase of work, and calculating the mean or average of those values. This is done so you can enter a range rather than a hard number for safety. The range should be based on your own knowledge of how long it takes to complete each task. Only you will know how long you take to complete these tasks. To better know that number, you may want to work outside the spreadsheet to break each task into sub-tasks that can be estimated in hours.</p>
    <p>When a starting date is entered for a task, an estimation of finishing date is calculated based on your value for the number of hours per day you can devote to the project which you enter at the bottom of the spreadsheet, and subtracting any holidays you specify (also at the bottom).</p>
    <h3>Calculating cost</h3>
    <p>Cost is calculated by taking the mean hours for a task and multiplying by the rate of pay you select. For this example, I use 3 different rates of pay. You will need to calculate your formulas to the appropriate rate of pay in the Cost column.</p>
    <h3>Estimating Hours</h3>
    <p>Coming up with these numbers will depend on the information that you gather in your request for information/statement of work produced with the client. You will llikely do a more broken down estimate of hours based on scope of work. The screen inventory is an example of a document that can be used to break down a task.</p>
    <h3>Modifying Calculations</h3>
    <p>Because you may only want to use part of this spreadsheet, e.g. give hard estimates without computing means and using only 1 pay rate, you may wish to edit the formulas included here. The sheet and its formulas are not protected, so you may want to configure your phases and tasks, rates and rate assignments, as well as holidays. You may then protect the document so it can be used for information entry only. Some knowledge of Excel is mandatory for modifying formulas.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>Michael Angeles and Konigi provide no warranty for the use of this spreadsheet. By electing to use this spreadsheet, the user acknowledges that any errors are the sole responsibility of the user, due to data entry, formula creation, calculation, or any use of this spreadsheet on the user's part.

  <section class="article-body"><p>So it's my birthday today. One thing that I've learned about birthdays from having a child, is that it's a lot of fun to give gifts away on your birthday. I'm now a seasoned goodie bag shopper and can tell you some interesting places to go in Manhattan and Brooklyn to find unusual gifts for boys age 8-10. But since I can't give all of you rare swag from Tokyo Toy, I thought I'd offer up a template that freelancers might find useful. </p>
<p>I've posted a <a href="../tools/schedule-and-cost-summary-calculator.html">Cost Estimate and Scheduling Calculator</a> spreadsheet to the <a href="../tools/overview/index.html">Tools</a>. The document provides a lightweight method for learning to estimate time to complete a web design project, and calculating cost for completion. The intended audience is individual freelancers or contractors. This may not be an ideal format for the calculation of project team estimates. </p>

<p>I hope this is useful to someone out there. I know there are other tools to do this sort of thing, but it never hurts to see examples of how others' get things like this done.</p>
<p>And no, I don't freelance anymore. I just hated to see this go to waste. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/plagiarism-vs-inspiration/">Plagiarism Vs. Inspiration</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>The recent <a href="../design/skittles.html">Skittles launch</a>, which appropriated Modernista's idea, and the <a href="milton-glaser-shepard-fairey-and-plagiarism.html">Shepard Fairey law suit</a>, which questions whether or not the artist has a first ammendment right to use images appropriated from an AP photohjournalist, is making me think more and more about the issue of plagiarism vs. inspiration. </p>
<p>I don't know who was involved with the making of the Skittles site, but it reminds me of how BBDO ripped off Spike Jonze's "Full Flared" video for its Skittles commercials. If, for instance, Modernista designed Skittles or Jonze directed the Snickers ad, I wouldn't be bothered. But this just feels like someone is plagiarizing and being lazy. I don't know how a creative agency can be this blatant and not think they're going to get called out for it. What's bothersome in all of this is that credit is not given to the original, permission is not granted I am sure.</p>
<p>I'm a firm believer in finding inspiration from others' work, but only if the concept and design is altered significantly enough that it becomes one's own and only marginally refers to the original. What Fairey does, in my opinion, pales in comparison to what these ad agencies are doing, and it can be debated whether or not his work is too close to the original and falls into the rules for fair use. I think it's pretty close and my opinion on that has been changing pretty regularly on the Fairey issue. What makes the issue sticky is that it is both art and it results in a commercial product. I think it would be less likely to be troublesome if the result was simply some form of communication or a more pure attempt at free speech. But the commercial aspect alters that view of the copy in my opinion.</p>
<p>In any case this is an issue that re-emerges constantly and becomes more and more laborious for me to think about and discuss each time it arises. </p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.uxrefresh.com/2009/02/a-to-z-index-examples/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt49a6a9ad425ae.jpg"/></a></div><p>uxRefresh has collected a handful of examples of <a href="http://www.uxrefresh.com/2009/02/a-to-z-index-examples/">A-Z indexes</a> of titles on large sites. Also useful might be a look at the article I wrote about <a href="#">KWIC/KWOC/A-Z Site Indexes</a> work I did while at Bell Labs, and for a deeper dive, look at the list of links of <a href="http://www.montague.com/review/AtoZ.htm">indexer-designed examples</a> on the Montague Institute's site. Many of the latter are still valid, but there's some link rot there too. James Kalbach also <a href="http://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/a-z-index-examples/">recently wrote on A-Z indexes</a>, and in particular demonstrated the use of indexes in search auto-completion using Elsevier bibliographic database EMBASE.</p>
<p>Exhaustive A-Z indexes of the variety that indexers produce with relationships among terms are rarely seen on larger sites. This is probably for good reason--search engines are often as effective in most cases and indexes requiring human, subject matter expert involvement are expensive. The kinds of places where these A-Z indexes are to be found are largely in bodies of content with some sort of specialized need, e.g. research databases. It's important to keep in mind, when comparing the above, that there is a difference between simply providing an index of titles of content, and providing an index of terms found in the content. The latter, in my opinion, is where the display of relationships and hierarchy can be most relevant and useful.</p>

You might have already seen this one, but as Dave points out, it is a great example of using personas, narrative, and really low fidelity sketches to demonstrate a concept.</p>
<p>The video above uses still photography, super-imposed photos of whiteboard drawings, and voice over narrative to describe the idea for a mobile phone application that helps a commuter to get to his ride on time, and even to remember to get off if he becomes engrossed in an article, for instance. Super idea, but what's really great about this is that how easy and inexpensive it probably was for them to produce this video. Good design doesn't need to be big and costly.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Thanks to @lorenbaxter's suggestion, I've enabled logging in with email rather than username if you prefer. Luckily Drupal's <a href="http://drupal.org/project/logintoboggan">logintoboggan</a> module allows admins to offer this option, as well as offering registration and signup without the roundtrip to email. Sweet. Thanks for making my life easier, Drupal.</p>
<p>This should help ease the experience of finding your file downloads as well if you bought stencils or icons form the store. It also brings me around to re-implementing  some of the features I put in in Feb-March last year and then took out, e.g. vote to promote on design and interface submissions. I have a minor redesign planned that hopes to bring that back, but will bring it back for signed in users.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="chrome://speeddial/content/speeddial.xul"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/konigi-notebooks-sxsw.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>So I've made some 8.5 in. by 5.25 in. graph paper notebooks because I wanted something a little more functional than what I was using for sketching. They're basically a mini version of the wireframe grid I use, with markers for 1/3s and 1/4s, but without the gutters. I've been working with a prototype of this for a few months now and have a bunch of these ready to put up for sale, but haven't been rushing to do it, mostly because I made them for myself and selling stuff like notebooks isn't profitable until you get into selling large quantities, and unfortunately I haven't the time to market the pads and books.</p>
<p>So I had a great idea for now. I am going to sell these eventually, when other higher priorities get out of the way, but for now, I'm going to start off by giving the first 30 or so away, starting with a little gift for my Konigi readers who happen to be able to make it to SXSW to hear the <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2186">wireframe panel</a> that Nick Finck, Donna Maurer and I are doing. After the talk, if you're one of the first 30 to come up to me and give me the secret word, which I'll announce on Twitter a few days before the talk, you'll get one of the books. My little thank you for being a reader and making it out to the talk.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.printmag.com/design_articles/MiltonGlaseronShepardFairey/tabid/492/Default.aspx"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/glaser-on-fairey.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Print Magazine <a href="http://www.printmag.com/design_articles/MiltonGlaseronShepardFairey/tabid/492/Default.aspx">interviews Milton Glaser to discuss Shepard Fairey</a> and the topic of appropriation and plagiarism. If you're not familiar, Fairey is the graffiti artist responsible for such iconic imagery as the ubiquitous Andre OBEY tag and the Obama Hope image. Glaser had this to say, on the topic of copying other artists' work:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process of looking back at the past is very accepted in our businessâ€”the difference is when you take something without adding anything to the conversation. ... I think unless youâ€™re modifying it and making it your own, youâ€™re on very tenuous ground. </p></blockquote>
<p>He makes the finer point that copying ideas and appropriating imagery is not patently wrong. To the contrary, it is the basis for a lot of work that is celebrated. The difference comes in appropriating and making one's own. He points out the danger the idea of copying poses to future designers and artists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Itâ€™s a dangerous example for students, if they see that appropriating peopleâ€™s work is the path to success. Simply reproducing the work of others robs you of your imagination and form-making abilities. Youâ€™re not developing the muscularity you need to invent your own ideas. ... But itâ€™s important for students to understand that any idea can be exploited, but not simply reproduced. </p></blockquote>
<p>I, for one, don't sit in judgement of Shepard Fairey's work because I find the idea of what he does, the mass underground distribution of iconic imagery in the form of an ilegal activity for spreading one's art, to be interesting for that controversial aspect alone. Is it art or is it vandalism? Is it stealing or is it some sort of free speech that should be protected? But, I digress on that issue, only to share what I think is provocative. Getting back to Glaser's point, if in the realm of design we tend to be gray on the issue of copying ideas or actual form without making a thing our own, what do we gain from that experience? Not very much, for not very long.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/language-we-use/">The Language We Use</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>In "<a href="http://davemalouf.com/?p=1560">The language we use</a>," David Malouf discusses how ideas about user interaction can become so ingrained in what we are familiar with, that our language begins to reflect that familiarity. That can lead to a natural tendency to explain away interaction without thought to what it means to the design of a thing. In this case a student describes the change of context in a sketch presentation by using the word "click" (as in clicks to go to the next screen). The absent minded use of the word "click" brings with it the connotations of a mouse click, and limits the possible set of interactions.</p>
<p>David makes two great observations here. First, that the way we talk about interaction design is as important as the visual elements of the design solutions we produce. The language we use, and in particular the selection of meaningful words that convey behaviors, and the intellectual content and analysis of our design is a closely bound component of what we're providing when we do design work. It is productive, therefore, to write about interactions (e.g. in your spec) and deconstruct what you write.</p>
<p>The second great observation David makes is that there is danger in the use of loaded language when it comes to describing interaction. Words like "click" explicitly point to the use of one type of input behavior, whether it's a mouse input or finger touch, that carry with it the limitations or constraints of that behavior. The same might be true of using certain conventions or design patterns. The use of a specific, familiar interface element, like a tab for instance, might lead to known but perhaps limiting behavior for a given application, that would hold the designer back from considering better alternatives for the interaction.</p>
<p>This discussion also reminds me of the thread started by Josh Kamler on <a href="designing-writing.html">"Designing by Writing."</a> It is extremely valuable to engage in writing and discussion about design through deconstruction. Even in the absence of a studio environment, we can learn to analyze what we design by paying particular attention to how we describe what we've designed when we write specs and re-reading and deconstructing what we've written, and actively engaging in regular critique of our work.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Sketches are often better tools for communicating designs than high fidelity illustrations or schematics. The purpose of the sketch style wireframe is to prevent the intended audience from thinking about visual design and focus on the functionality and behavior you are proposing.</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce the <a href="http://shop.konigi.com/product/omnigraffle-sketch-stencils?q=store/product/omnigraffle-sketch-stencils">release of this set of sketch stencils</a> for OmniGraffle, based on the Wireframe Stencil. This set of user interface sketch stencils is designed for OmniGraffle 5.x. OG4 users are able to use the stencils by changing the .gstencil extensions to .graffle. The sketch kit contains all of the UI elements you'll find in the free Wireframe Stencils we provide at Konigi, plus additional shapes and elements to make it easier for you to adjust to this style of wireframing.</p>
<p> As usual, I'm sticking to the goal of keeping the tools on this site inexpensive or free. Your $10 purchase of this stencil set entitles you to free upgrades forever.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/untitled-document-syndrome/">Untitled Document Syndrome</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/02/untitled_document_syndrome">John Gruber laments</a> the illogical, yet human, tendency to avoid saving new documents, which occasionally leads users to the loss of data when an "Untitled Document" is left in limbo and a crash leaves them scrambling to figure out what happened to it. The point is that users often can't be bothered with things like figuring out where to put this thing on a file system because we're too busy with the task at hand, e.g. writing the thing that we might not have a name or place for yet.</p>
<p>Good software would save users from their non-saving, human selves. Software needs to offer a way to protect us from our laziness (and I say that as someone who is very lazy about certain things) by providing systematic methods for frictionless data protection and recovery. We're talking about the realm of usability principles that Jef Raskin wrote about, e.g. providing undos rather than dialogs for destructive actions. </p>
<p>Gruber also talks about the "i" apps' implicit handling of things like file system paths in iTunes and iPhoto, which take care of file organization for you, so you can just focus on things that makes sense to you, like albums and playlists, and let the system just do the file management for you in a logical manner. Gruber also writes of the autosave intelligence in apps like Stickies and BBEdit, which auto-save in the background unbeknownst to the user, and upon return from an abandoned session, data is back where she left it, in whatever state they left it in. </p>
<p>These are frictionless applications--those that lets users get to the main task that brought them to the app in the first place, e.g. writing, uploading photos and music, without having to think of things like the file system. This is design for use, and not for micro-managing control. It's getting directly to the point of using the application, and avoiding obstacles like thinking about how to use the application.</p>
<p>I think this is the vision most of us, concerned with ease of use, espouse and want for our apps. I speak out of both sides of my mouth sometimes, opting for micro-managing some things, e.g. I've used a photo management app based on my camera/year/ file organization rather than using iPhoto's file management, but I let iTunes manage all my music and video data. But the point is, most people probably don't want to micromanage that organization.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/20-steps-better-wireframing/">20 Steps to Better Wireframing</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/thinkvitamin-wireframing.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>Think Vitamin's Clive Howard says "Wireframing is one of the first steps in your planning process and arguably itâ€™s one of the most important ones." In this article, Howard goes through the wireframing process, discussing who should be involved, which tools to use, and offers sound tips to enable you to make better wireframes. </p>
<p>Among my favorite points are those about ownership and involvement. This is to do with ensuring that someone is driving the process and iterations, and making sure that the interaction design process doesn't happen in a vacuum, but is reviewed, validated, and informed by key team members, e.g. engineers, as you're creating them. </p>
<p>I also like the points about fidelity, and avoiding doing too much design. That said, if you're also the visual  designer, or can base the visual language of the wireframe to the visual language of agreed upon visual design specs, then I don't see a problem doing that.</p>
<p>What I don't agree with, is that you want to avoid designing behaviors such as Flash or AJAX. Wireframes, storyboards, and sketches are the precisely place to explore how websites and applications should behave. You needn't be as specific as specifying types of transitions, just generalized behaviors and relationship to system logic. If you don't specify behaviors, decisions will get made without your input. If that's fine with you, leave them out. But you're supposed to be the expert on your users, how they've modeled the site or app, and what they expect to do there. </p>
<p>Lastly, one point that is missing for me is know how to pitch/present the wireframes. These aren't just documents to be chucked over the wall. While they should be able to stand on their own when it comes time to design or develop what you've specified, your job is not done when you've shipped the doc. You have to present and justify, explain details, and answer to questions that will undoubtedly arise about how things behave. For this reason, I rely very heavily on annotating wireframes and storyboarding behaviors. Those questions will need to get answered eventually. If you don't think you deserve to be in that conversation, leave them out, because someone else will make those decisions without you. But if you intend to be involved in the user experience, why not be involved in every aspect of design, and make sure your wireframing process allows others to be inform what you produce.</p>
<p>There's quite a bit of good stuff in Howard's points, so be sure to <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/features/20-steps-to-better-wireframing/">read the article</a> to find out what each of the bullet points above refer to.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/bill-buxton-how-keep-innovating/">Bill Buxton on How to Keep Innovating</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>In BusinessWeek, Bill Buxton discusses <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/feb2009/id20090218_337947.htm">how to keep innovating</a>, with the main idea being that you can continue to cultivate creativity and innovation by finding new things that you have a passion for. He suggests that when you get good enough at a thing, you should find something else to be passionate about, and commit and throw yourself into learning how to do it. You'll be bad at it at first, but the experience of learning something new, no matter how bad you are at it at first, may affect your creativity in positive ways that you won't realize until you experience it. In some cases, they may inform what you are already expert at, and in others lead you in entirely new and surprising directions.</p>
<p>The discussion reminds me of Paula Scher's talk focussing on <a href="paula-scher-gets-serious-ted.html">serious versus solemn design</a> at TED. Scher spoke about the different times in her career where she was able to be most innovative in her craft, and the thing that was common in each case was that she was doing something new--something she didn't know much about when she started that particular project. The fact that one has no reference point or bearing can lead to innovative thinking.</p>
<p>This is the same argument Buxton is making. I think Buxton is saying that the continued pursuit of new endeavors itself, is what can help cultivate one's creativity and create the pre-conditions for innovation. I'm sure a lot of people who take up new hobbies and have the continuing need to learn see the obvious in this. This is one of the reasons I feel at home in a city where it is easy for me to start investigating and learning something new all the time. Being in a city isn't necessary, per se, but being able to get inspired and start doing something new is a hell of a lot easier for me here. This coupled with the fact that my wife and I homeschool our 8 year old son, which has lead me to dive deep on countless topics and project that I would never have held my interest in the past. If you read my personal blog, you know about my forays into toy making, game design, character creation and storytelling. </p>
<p>In any case, the story is not new, but is a reminder for me that being well-rounded and having many interests is a good thing. In fact it's one of the top criteria I've used when participating in the hiring of people.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.comparenetworks.com/developers/jqueryplugins/jbreadcrumb.html"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt499c2a038a7ca.jpg"/></a></div><p>The <a href="http://www.comparenetworks.com/developers/jqueryplugins/jbreadcrumb.html">JQuery'd Breadcrumb</a> is an odd breadcrumb interface that collapses all nodes in the branch upon page load, and then expands to show each node the user mouses over. Their explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>This collapsible breadcrumb was developed to deal with deeply nested, verbosely named pages. Rather than limit the amount of elements shown on the sever side, we decided to go with a client side solution for usability and SEO reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don't see how this is a usability improvement over an exposed breadcrumb. If they needed/wanted to use breadcrumbs for whatever reason, it would seem more usable to show a larger truncated portion of each string with an elipsis, and expose the string on hover, rather than just show these strange portions of the string. I don't even see the whole first character, so it just looks kind of broken in a way.</p>
<p>I like the attempt to do something about minimizing breadcrumbs in deep paths. But it might even be more useful to use something like the path control we're accustomed to in the Finder and Windows Explorer. You'd have to do a lot to make it look less like a form control to make it unobtrusive, but provide some context. Do it with ULs and CSS, and I think you'd still be ok with regard to SEO, although someone might correct me if I'm wrong. I don't know why you'd allow horrendously long titles as in their example, but clearly you don't need to have the current node in the branch visible if the point is to minimize the weight of this UI element.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://labs.nypl.org/2009/02/16/introducing-infomaki-bite-sized-usability-testing/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/notebook/nypl-infomaki.jpg" class="notebook-image" /></a></div><p>The New York Public Library Labs has begun testing a <a href="http://labs.nypl.org/2009/02/16/introducing-infomaki-bite-sized-usability-testing/">light usability testing system</a> to supplement their formal tests, inspired by the <a href="http://fivesecondtest.com/">Five Second Test</a> method which was devised by Jared Spool and turned into a service by the guys at mayhem(method).  The service, nicknamed Infomaki (info roll?), combines the type of service 5 second test provides, as well as allowing single question surveys for checking on things like simple labeling issues, which you might have tested using card sorting.</p>
<p>The test lets you answer only 1 question, or continue answering as you like, which makes the task feel very game like, and reminds me of crowdsourcing apps like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. I love that the types of questions you can ask require simple twitch-like responses, so you can get through a lot very quickly. Here's a bit more from the NYPL Labs site about the project: </p>
<blockquote><p>It has become apparent that we needed a tool in our kit that would allow us to get simple usability questions in front of users with a minimum of fuss.</p>
<p>[O]ften, what is needed is just a sanity checkâ€“ a reassurance to our team that we are on the right track.</p>
<p>Our design sessions frequently result in debate about which of two words is more compelling or accurate for our users, or whether a particular button is noticeable in a particular location. When we can, we test designs on real people using paper or digital prototypes, but it is impractical to test every day; sitting down with real people is not always as simple as youâ€™d expect, what with the schedules of busy New Yorkers.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve used SurveyMonkey in the past for full-fledged traditional surveys, and weâ€™ve also evaluated OptimalSort for online card sorting, and been inspired by the Five Second Test. But none of them were a perfect fit, for reasons including complicated interfaces, inflexible setup, privacy policy hassles, and/or lack of a way to embed a link back to our site when the test is completed.</p>
<p>So, we set out to create our own rapid-testing usability laboratory from scratch, and last Tuesday we launched it, in rough beta form.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having worked on information systems in research libraries, I'm always excited to see libraries that are ahead of the curve in terms of technology, and the NYPL never fails to impress. The NYPL Labs is testing the system with a small number of usability questions related to NYPL sites now, so you might get some repeat questions, as I did. It would be great if the system could cookie sessions to ensure that questions aren't repeated. This is a terrific start though. The NYPL Labs plan to release Infomaki as an open source application, which is great news for us.</p>
