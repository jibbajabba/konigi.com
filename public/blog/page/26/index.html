  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://namethis.com/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt484d6ccbd1bbe.jpg"/></a></div><p><a href="http://namethis.com/">NameThis</a> is an innovative new crowdsourced community that uses the wisdom of crowds to name products and services. Companies or individuals who are looking to name something pay $99 to request help in naming the thing. Participants provide suggestions and vote or invest a stake in the suggestions that have been posted. <a href="http://kluster.com/">Kluster's</a> robots decide which is best, and participants get paid back when they've invested in the winner. You can find out more about <a href="http://namethis.com/name_this/projects/new">how it works</a>.</p>
<p>The UI shows the list of projects posted and a countdown for the time remaining to participate. It's pretty interesting stuff if taken seriously by the participants. I suspect the payoffs will keep things from going sour. </p>
<p>Some of the winners have been good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local Shopping Search Engine = Nearbuy</li>
<li>TechCrunch Elevator Pitches = CrunchTime</li>
</ul>
<p>Others I thought were only so-so. Sadly, I can't find a list to view the archive of all past projects.</p>
<p>Definitely might be worth the price of entry for the creatively challenged.</p>

<p>On the Dolores blog, Brendan <a href="http://blog.doloreslabs.com/2008/03/where-does-blue-end-and-red-begin/">explains</a> how Mechanical Turk was used to present a set of random colors to participants in an exercise designed to observe how people name colors. The project was inspired by the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/">World Color Survey</a>. </p>
<p>The result was the color explorer, aka "The Amazing Color Label Wheel!" The explorer allows you to enter color words to filter the visualization. The data set has been released so you can do more visualizations on your own.</p>

In his list, he drops some thoughts that simply reflect the era of the present and past 15 years, and in others he provides nuggets of wisdom. Here's a sampling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody's doin' it</li>
<li>Small things are often (usually?) more important than big things.<br />
"It" is about the way every individual conducts himself or herself. (E.g., the hotel housekeeper, restaurant busboy.)</li>
<li>Aesthetics and usability are equally important—with perhaps a slight edge to usability. ("'It won a prize' is the ultimate criticism."—Don Norman</li>
<li>"It" must be on every (literally) agenda; in project reviews of every type "it" must hold its own with, say, the budget discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only wish "it" was formatted in HTML bullets (unordered links) so it was more readable. :)</p>

Allender is creating 1 new skin every month in 2008. The first in the series are the <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com/2007/12/09/gridline-lite/">Gridline themes</a>, a pared down, minimal design that comes in three flavors: lite, news, and magazine. Any of these should provide a barebones framework for a small business looking to use WordPress to get their site up and running quickly. From the base stylesheet you can tweak CSS to suit your brand. </p>
<p>Of course, the danger in using themes like this out of the box is that your site ends up looking like scores of others. Most of these look like <a href="http://subtraction.com/">Subtraction</a> with subtle variations and added content modules, so take the time to customize the theme.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/designing-inside-out/">Designing from the Inside Out</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://interactions.acm.org/content/?p=1101"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4845c68eaefef.jpg"/></a></div><p>Laura Richardson writes in <a href="http://interactions.acm.org/content/?p=1101">interactions magazine, May/June 2008</a> (subscription required for full text) about a philosophy of industrial design whose goal is to "get to the heart of the matter&#8212;meaningful interactions at the core of great product design." In a sense, I can boil this down to needs. People have needs, explicit and unexpressed, that have to be described in relation to your product. The successful products are those where the flow between need and fulfillment are fluid and natural.</p>
<p>This design philosophy is based on the idea that the experience with the product necessarily connects the user's desire or impetus for use with the manifestation and interaction with the product. Designing towards these goals is not simply a matter of form following function, but, more importantly, relating to desire and emotion. "Form ... is designed to interact, reflect, and engage with the interior as well as the external audience." </p>
<p>Inside-Out design considers interior issues such as purpose/function, desire, and emotion on one hand. On the other hand, it thinks about the exterior elements of form, interfaces, physical use, possibilities and limitations of the medium. The resulting experience&#8212;the outcome of I-O design&#8212;reflects the process of designing the product to reflect elements of the interior. Richardson goes on to describe the process used for doing I-O design of a smarter driving glove that produces better feedback, and a medical ID that considers the emotional needs of those who need them.  </p>
<p>All projects must start with understanding the fundamental goals and desires driving the reason for the product's existence. What Richardson is exposing in the examples is the process that led to solutions. It's really like the unfolding of a story. It starts with an expression of fundamental desires, talks about how the desires need to touch the product, continues with designers aware of these internal needs making sure they are met, and ends with people using the product to meet their needs. Oh, and somewhere afterward, someone makes money off the process. :)</p>
<p>Designers of web sites and applications who invest any time in user research, and factor this information into the design process, are already engaged in this type of activity. We have good examples of how rich applications have innovated the web with AJAX, for example. One example that comes to mind are interfaces that use AJAX to focus on efficiency when the primary need is to get things done. Or controls that anticipate what your next step will be, depending on the context of your actions. The innovation comes in the form of re-thinking what could conventionally be done, or what could be created to feel cool, and instead focussing what can be made to get to the heart of what user's desire, and what their emotional needs are.</p>
<p>The thrust of the article is that some industrial design has, in recent years, fetishized the package to the detriment of the experience. Designers can avoid that trap by re-focusing on interior needs.</p>

<p>The developer announcement described the migration to the new requirements.</p>
<blockquote><p>When a user goes to an application for the first time and is prompted to log in, she will see a simpler screen, like in the screen shot here. Once a user authorizes your application, you can utilize all the API methods that access information about the user, publish stories to News Feed and Mini-Feed, and send the user notifications.</p></blockquote>
<p>Above all, I like that this puts control in the hands of Facebook users. TechCrunch <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/02/facebook-applications-arent-meant-to-be-installed/">criticized</a> Facebook for not taking stronger measures when dealing with app developers who use spammy methods, and argued that the method by which Facebook modifies the platform rules so drastically should concern the developer community. I agree on the point of making developers more accountable when they decide to play the evil game of deceiving users.</p>
<p>This seems like interesting news to me. Facebook are the Apple of social networking. That is to say, people watch very closely for the disruptive innovation they introduce and tend to react to that innovation, and we see it repeated in other social networking sites. I am thankful when the evolution moves in a direction that benefits user control and protection. Hopefully this means I'll see a huge reduction in the number of unwanted invitations to install crappy Facebook apps. </p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/marissa-mayer-talks-google-io/">Marissa Mayer Talks at Google IO</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Marissa Mayer, VP of search products and user experience at Google, discusses simplicity, the importance of testing and looking at statistics and data, the desire to look into the future and think about the long term, to solve impossible and everyday problems, and of course playing at what interests you. The event is blogged by <a href="http://blog.eloyz.com/google-io-marissa-mayer-with-a-glimpse-under-the-hood-of-google">Eloy Zuniger, Jr.</a> and covered by <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208400949">Information Week</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like a few old topics are discussed that I've read in past articles. In some cases, more pieces of some puzzles fell into place. I found one piece of the talk provided some interesting feedback on the impact of the minimal search page. </p>
<p>Mayer discussed the history of simplicity on the search page. In truth, simplicity as a principle was not what determined the spare design. Google didn't have a webmaster at the time and Sergey didn't do HTML. Mayer reported that the absence of a lot of content on the page had an odd side effect with users, which they observed in early testing. </p>
<p>InfoWeek reports Mayer saying, "[S]earchers would load the Google home page and wait for upwards of a minute in some cases. Asked why, the testers, accustomed to pages chock full of content, said they were waiting for the rest of the page to load. That's why Google.com has a copyright notice at the end of its home page, said Mayer, to indicate that the page has loaded and that searching can begin."</p>
<p>Is also interesting to read about the attitude different teams have taken to difficult problems, and how they try to improve the experience with everyday problems. Google Health, GOOG 411, and Ride Finder are great examples of that. </p>
<p>I find the Google approach to problem solving fascinating at a high level, because, they're looking at fundamental problems and are engineering solutions that affect every day life profoundly. When you think about it, this is the key thing, in my opinion that makes Google interesting&8212;the ability to look at  problems we experience in the world, and think about how technology can be used beat a path to solutions, no matter how difficult the problem appears on the surface.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/measuring-usability-everyday-products/">Measuring the Usability of Everyday Products</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/ISO20282.html">David Travis reports</a> for UserFocus on "<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=34122">ISO 2082, Ease of Operation of Every Day Products.</a>" While web-focussed interaction designers and information architects may not be involved in the design of everyday products, we should probably be interested at a high level, in the processes discussed. As Travis points out, clients are increasingly concerned with objective measurements of usability, and standards such as this "...will help ensure that we have robust and reliable test methods for all interactive designs, whether these are products, software or web sites." </p>
<p>ISO2082 is a new standard for the measurement of usability in everyday products. The document provides requirements and recommendations for the design of easy-to-operate everyday products. Its intended audience includes usability specialists, ergonomists, product designers, interaction designers, product manufacturers, and others involved in the design and development of everyday products.</p>
<p>The document is organized into 4 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design requirements for context of use and user characteristics.</li>
<li>Test method for walk-up-and-use products.</li>
<li>Test method for consumer products.</li>
<li>Test method for the installation of consumer products.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a designer of web products who only gets involved in discount usability testing, this standard is a curiosity to me more than anything. As Travis notes, testing consumer products is primarily concerned with determining if the product helps users achieve the most frequent and/or important user goal that the product is intended to support. So we're talking about tests of large groups over small sets of tasks in short periods of time. This is the kind of thing that is best handled by a dedicated usability team or consultant. </p>
<p>I think we designers, at minimimum need only be aware of the process proposed here, and the relevance this may have with regard to having a standardized process to reference with clients or usability consultants.</p>

<p>The site is showing very cool demos right now including dragging and dropping photos from the desktop to a web browser, live image manipulation, and live refreshing IRC chatrooms in the browser. One of the nice things about how this is implemented is that when you've arrived at a site requiring BrowserPlus, the software is installed in your browser and does not require a restart.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/google-gives-glimpse-future-gears-goodies/">Google Gives Glimpse of Future Gears Goodies</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9954418-2.html">Webware reports</a> that Chris Prince, a lead Gears engineer, provided some insight into what Google plans to do with Gears to advance the web browser's reach into the desktop. Among the features mentioned are notifications on the desktop of various events, support for location information, better interactions with a computer's file system, and technology to let large file uploads proceed even when hampered by intermittent network connectivity. </p>
<p>Prince demonstrated the following prototypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One let a Web page create a shortcut icon on a computer's desktop so people could launch that Web application with a double-click instead of a more laborious process.</li>
<li>A notification process, which like Yahoo's BrowserPlus feature ties into a computer's general system notification abilities, is a major missing piece in letting Web applications seize a user's attention the way desktop apps can. "Web apps have this problem where they can't tell users about important things happening on their system," Prince said.</li>
<li>His file system demonstration showed a dialog box that let him select a large group of photos for upload rather than the one-file-at-a-time process that today afflicts Web site operations.</li>
<li>A "blob"-processing ability could be used, for example, to divide a large file into bite-sized pieces, an approach that makes it easier to restore an upload interrupted by a bad network connection.</li>
<li>He used a geolocation-processing ability to process latitude-longitude information to provide a more useful Google map showing bars near Moscone Center in San Francisco. </li>

<li><a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2008/0430_great_number.php">Great Numbers, Not So Great Design</a>, by Khoi Vinh in Subtraction<br />
This craft, and whatever pretensions to art it can pull off, rests so much on the efficiency of transferring ideas from the brain to the hand. This means that in its ideal form, it works best when practiced by a single person. The perfect design staff is a single designer who can conceive of and execute an idea from start to finish — a straight shot from the right brain to the wrist — maintaining the same coherent creative vision throughout. ... The problem is that the structures of most larger design businesses cannot effectively facilitate the the transmittal of ideas. They don’t allow good design to happen, because they are overburdened with the organizational overhead of running a business.</li>

When you’ve got a small group, you don’t need to constantly formalize things. You communicate and you know what’s going on. If you have a question about something, you ask someone. Formalized rules, deadlines, and documents start to seem silly. ... If you’re working in a group bigger than 15 people, you’re fighting human nature.</li>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/ok-cancel-or-cancel-ok/">OK-Cancel or Cancel-OK?</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Jakob Nielsen's latest Alertbox recommends that <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ok-cancel.html">order of OK vs Cancel</a> should be determined by the standard order defined by the platform's interface guidelines. Alas, if you're designing for the web, order becomes problematic because Windows interface guidelines put OK first, whereas Apple guidelines put it last. Nielsen suggests that you base the order on the installed platform of your audience, i.e. if you have predominantly Windows users, you might be best served by putting OK on the left.</p>
<p>The best part of this essay is that he provides persuasive arguments for either side, making it easy to see how user interface designers can pick a side and use the argument to justify a decision. But the main argument here is to use what your users are accustomed to, and when you can, write more meaningful labels than "OK" for your confirmation button. </p>
<p>As web designers we challenge the notion that how we do form interfaces needs to follow interface guidelines strictly. If we're smart, we stay aware of these guidelines and the Human Factors research that has gone into designing interface rules followed by traditional software designers. But, most of the time that we're dealing with buttons, we're not dealing with dialogs with only OK/Cancel buttons. Often we're designing lengthier forms. </p>
<p>So what happens if we look at our user statistics and decide that what our users are accustomed to sucks? We might feel justified to think about form design and how it applies to the web and go against the conventional rules for Windows and Apple interfaces. In the case of dealing with OK/Cancel buttons, for example, many interface designers opt to treat Cancel as a link rather than as a button. This way, we end up minimizing the Cancel button and encouraging the user to gravitate towards the submission button. </p>
<p>If you're interested in how to tackle forms for the web, Luke Wroblewski deals with issues like this and more in his excellent book <em><a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/webforms/">Web Form Design: Filling in the blanks</a></em>.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Lou Rosenfeld shares the <a href="http://louisrosenfeld.com/home/bloug_archive/2008/05/questions_for_iaim_vendors.html">questions one should pose</a> when engaging prospective consulting firms for information architecture and information management project work. This list of questions should be very valuable if you are on the customer end of a client-vendor relationship. </p>
<p>It also seems like it would be an interesting list of questions to think about if you're a consultant and have never been on the customer end. As a consultant, you probably already ask many of these questions of prospective clients as well, as part of your first client interview about a new project. If you're on that end, this gives an idea of the kinds of things to be prepared to answer. </p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/2527203491/" title="TextFlow by jibbajabba, on Flickr"><img src="//farm3.static.flickr.com/2355/2527203491_f3311cf739_o.png" class="notebook-image" alt="TextFlow" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.textflow.com/">TextFlow</a> is a new parallel document editing application and service that allows multiple users to work on a document simultaneously. The service should appeal to people who use the Track Changes feature of Microsoft Word. TextFlow lets users edit documents, and instantly see the changes suggested. One person can review the changes and apply them. </p>
<p>The difference between this service and something like Google Docs or working in a wiki, is that the changes are indicated visually, rather than having to go through the diff displays in revision history. It's simple and should be intuitive for users who use Track Changes in Word. </p>
<p>The service is currently in beta, and you can view a screencast demonstration on the TextFlow site.</p>

  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.schmap.com/iphone/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4836af0584142.jpg"/></a></div><p><a href="http://schmap.com/">Schmap</a> provides a local guide service for major cities. Listings are provided with general guide information, reviews, photos, and location on a map. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.schmap.com/iphone/">iPhone service</a> attempts to maximize the unique features of that device.  Listings are simple lists with thumbnails, but if you rotate the phone to landscape orientation, the listings then display alongside a map with markers to show where each place is located. Rotating back returns to the list view. You can click on an item to view the detailed info. The info pages resemble address book entries in the iPhone. </p>
<p>Another different approach they've taken to displaying list views can be found in their pagination. The lists contain a footer pinned to the bottom of the window. You can either use Prev/Next buttons to page through, or perform a 2-fingered scroll to move through the list in smaller increments. This seems like a different sort of interaction that I haven't experienced before. Scrolling in the iPhone can be a bit strange because of the lack of feedback about length of page that a scrollbar provides. This type of interface is trying to provide combined scrolling and pagination. </p>
<p>Schmap is different in that it isn't just tacking an IUI front end to its service. I've tried their client application and their normal web site, and find that the iPhone application is quite a bit more pleasant to use and look at.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/roku-netflix-player/">Roku Netflix Player</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body">  <div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/"><img src="//media.konigi.com/bluga/wt4832e7e599724_0.jpg"/></a></div><p>Yet <a href="http://www.roku.com/netflixplayer/">another set top box makes a move to bring the 10 foot Internet TV and movie experience to your living room</a>. This time Roku, maker of the Soundbridge audio player, has teamed up with Netflix to deliver their video on demand service to a set top box designed for Netflix service only. The $100 box allows you to navigate your queue, view show/movie information, and stream videos that were previously only available for Internet streaming to Windows users previously. It's not apparent if you can browse videos outside of your queue. </p>
<p>For Netflix users, the service is included free of charge if your plan allows Internet streaming. The streaming catalog still only hovers around 10,000 movies compared to the 100,000 available DVDs.  This is mostly older titles, but that's still not a bad number and you can expect the catalog to grow. I can confirm that I see about 10% of my queue with Play Now options presently. Sadly, the box doesn't deliver HD, so expect VCR quality video.</p>
<p>This move brings Netflix further into the Internet-enabled set top box subcategory of the Video on Demand market   with manufacturers including Apple and VUDU. Look for cable set top boxes to incorporate more of these services over time, and with that, the introduction of yet more features into already crowded 10 foot menus.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/why-zappos-pays-new-employees-quit/">Why Zappos Pays New Employees to Quit</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>The stories of Zappos' commitment to superior customer service has become nearly legendary. From regular upgrades to next day delivery at no cost to the story of a customer service reps <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/above-and-beyond/zappos-sends-you-flowers-311369.php">delivery of flowers</a> to a customer whos mother passed away. Now, in Harvard Business Online, Bill Taylor tells of Zappos' unusual customer training program. <a href="http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/taylor/2008/05/wy_zappos_pays_new_employees_t.html">Zappos offers new employees a $1000 offer to quit</a> after a 4 week training session. The idea behind this tactic is that by weeding out people who take the offer, they keep the ones who will be committed to the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>Because if you’re willing to take the company up on the offer, you obviously don’t have the sense of commitment they are looking for. It’s hard to describe the level of energy in the Zappos culture&#8212;which means, by definition, it’s not for everybody. Zappos wants to learn if there’s a bad fit between what makes the organization tick and what makes individual employees tick&#8212;and it’s willing to pay to learn sooner rather than later. (About ten percent of new call-center employees take the money and run.) </p>
<p>... </p>
<p>It’s a small practice with big implications: Companies don’t engage emotionally with their customers—people do. If you want to create a memorable company, you have to fill your company with memorable people.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that's innovative thinking&#8212;being willing to pay to find and keep committed employees.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/rise-contextual-user-interfaces/">The Rise of Contextual User Interfaces</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>In Alex Iskold's article, <a href="http://alexiskold.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/the-rise-of-contextual-user-interfaces/">The Rise of Contextual User Interfaces</a>, the writer and CEO of software company AdaptiveBlue talks about the rise of contextual interfaces on the desktop an in the services we use on the web.</p>
<p>He points out the failing of choice over context in the old paradigm of UI design. Standardization of UI elements (tabs, combo boxes, etc.) was meant as a way to keep users from having to learn how to use an interface. The argument made was apparently that users are stupid and this paradigm supported the idea that we shouldn't innovate on core UI elements because users wouldn't be able to figure out how to user our applications. But over time UI designers simply made all of the choices available in an application in the forefront, putting the burden of having to sift through all of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another philosophy of the old UI approach was that the user wants to see all information all the time. Instead of building UIs that responded to the way that people actually interacted with the tool, the user interface opened up all possible choices at all times. Naturally, this is completely overwhelming and confusing to people.</p></blockquote>
<p>The result of the users are stupid/let's show all the choices paradigm ends up being, unfortunately, that even if users are smart enough to use these interfaces, they often end up feeling stupid when they can't figure out how to use bloated UIs. Sadly, many of these UIs make software so difficult to grok that we become frustrated using them, and often simply choose not use them.</p>
<p>The strategy of innovating interface elements based on usage and using simpler, contextual interfaces is the antithesis of the old paradigm, and is what is offered to rescue users from the flood of choices in lazily designed interfaces.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new interfaces are winning people over because they are based on usage patterns instead of choices. The key thing about new UIs is that they are contextual - presenting the user with minimal components and then changing in reaction to user gestures. Thanks to Apple, we have seen a liberating movement towards simplistic, contextual interfaces. </p></blockquote>
<p>Alex tells the story of something his boss once told him, declaring that user interface are cheap. What the boss meant was, that "the UI is so essential and so important to get right that you shouldn’t just reuse code and widgets."</p>
<p>Iskold points to Apple's ability to continually innovate on its interface, but points out that the use of contextual interfaces has increased on the web due to the use of the richer set of interactions provided by AJAX and RIA tools such as Flash. The example that many of us have commonly use are the controls provided by flash video sites when we hover over video players (e.g. in YouTube, Vimeo, etc.). These players hide the controls for viewing embedding options, related videos, etc. until you make the conscious decision to move the mouse over the video. Use of AJAX to make expert features available via expanding/collapsing and hiding/displaying design patterns are another example of contextual controls that can be provided nearby when needed.</p>
<p>Some of the innovations using contextual controls even break the traditional rules for how these controls work, but in the new model, this is done to provide emphasis to function over form. In the eyes of interface designers, the belief seems to be, "when an efficiency can be provided by breaking the rules, why not do it?"</p>
