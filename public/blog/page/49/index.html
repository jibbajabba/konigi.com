    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/designing-writing/">Designing by Writing</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p>I love what tiny gigantic has written in this great short <a href="http://www.tinygigantic.com/2009/02/11/designing-by-writing-or-the-non-iterative-design-process/">post about designing by writing</a> (or the non-iterative design process). I agree wholeheartedly, although I think of writing as part of design to be accretive and/or iterative. </p>
<p>A few choice bits from the entry:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hen someone asks you why you used green, or why you included that crumpled-paper background, or why there’s a bird in the logo, you’re gonna need to know. What’s more, you’re going to need to be able to articulate it in a way that makes them care. I’ve been in graphic design classes in which I’ve asked students presenting their work why they did what they did. And 90% of them have said something like: “because it’s like, I don’t know. It’s like I thought that color looked super good right there. And I like birds.”</p>
<p>... </p>
<p>It’s not enough to make pretty things. You’ve got to be able to talk about them, to present them, to parse their meaning. And the truth of it is that if you can’t articulate what the thing you’re making means, you’re gonna have a helluva time making it mean something to someone else. Which is a problem, because that’s the job. </p></blockquote>
<p>I like to write before I do anything related to interaction design. I like to read, gather and summarize loads of user feedback, to talk among my team about ideas we have to solve problems, and then distill it all into statements of the problem, proposals for design concepts, and stories (use cases and scenarios). This is all the intellectual work of design. Where I work now, it happens in a wiki article with users adding paragraph comments, all before I start to sketch. Then it continues to happen when my team annotates sketches.</p>
<p>In any case, the point is that the thought process that leads to design is what's important, and if there is none, then maybe writing can help in that case. Perhaps not everyone needs to write so much as communicate and capture in some way, even if it's only in discussion and notetalking or what have you.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/good-design-replicable/">Is Good Design Replicable?</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p>Joshua Porter's <a href="http://bokardo.com/archives/is-good-design-replicable/">post about whether good design can be replicated</a> is fabulous. What I like is the idea that there isn't a solid set of methods that you can reuse in every case and think it might guarantee success or "good design". There's an interesting thought in there about process:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder if the real issue is that most of the time designers simply don’t know if what they’re building is great, and they end up relying on process to get as far as they can. If they go through the right process, they think, then they’ll produce maybe not the best solution, but the best solution possible. This may be true…and it is comforting, in a way, because if you feel like you are doing it right then you can sleep soundly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Couldn't we just say that all this activity that leads to design, whether it uses one methodology or another, just helps frame the problem and start the discussion about understanding what you're trying to solve before the eureka moments hits. We're not talking about sticking to rigor here, but maybe using tools and methods to get to some moment of clarity before carrying on to the design that can now be given focus.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/entry.html?id=17485">Michael Bierut passage</a> is a great one, in that he suggests that he works at the problem in one way or another until the solution manifests almost magically. And Joshua suggests that perhaps it's just hard work, and I would say experience, that makes good design. I'd side with that opinion, if I had to side with anything.</p>

    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://jounce.net/blog/2009/jan/28/when-sitemaps-dont-work-two-alternatives/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt49999b9d531cb.jpg"/></a></div><p>Interesting discussion in M. Jackson Wilkinson&rsquo;s blog about the <a href="http://jounce.net/blog/2009/jan/28/when-sitemaps-dont-work-two-alternatives/">altnernatives to hierarchical sitemaps</a>, and the use of concept maps or user flows as alternatives when hierarchy doesn&rsquo;t work in your documentation. </p>
<p>I have to agree with one point, in that site maps don&rsquo;t always serve documentation well when the notion of a strict hierarchy just doesn&rsquo;t exist. But I think there&rsquo;s utility in sitemaps at conveying the organization of a site or application at some level. It may be a very high level visualization that maps concept model/mental models to navigation or application menus, and provides a way for a team to visualize the connections between what the user sees and what the system represents in UI. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t do sitemaps very often anymore, especially when working on application design. They get you far enough in terms of conveying a 1,000 foot view of the landscape, but the meat of the documentation seems to be in uncovering topography. And that can be the stuff of quite a few deliverable types, including user flows, use cases. A nice list of deliverables that might be suitable is in Peter Morvilles&rsquo; <a href="user-experience-deliverables.html">UX Deliverables run down</a>. </p></p>

<p>Dan Saffer gave a fantastic NYC IXDA presentation, <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2761844">Tap Is the New Click</a>, discussing the rise of touch interfaces, their place and adoption in society, and the role of the interaction designer in designing these direct manipulation interfaces. Every IA and IXD needs to watch this. A summary of the talk below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though the technology has been around for decades, only now are we starting to see mass production and adoption of touchscreen and gestural devices for the public. Jeff Han&rsquo;s influential 2006 TED demonstration of his multitouch system, followed by the launches of Nintendo&rsquo;s Wii, Apple&rsquo;s iPhone, and Microsoft Surface, have announced a new era of interaction design, one where gestures in space and touches on a screen will be as prominent as pointing and clicking.</p>
<p>But how do you create products for this new paradigm? While most of us know how to design desktop and web applications, what do you need to know to design for interactive gestures?</p>
<p>This introduction to designing gestural interfaces will cover the basics: usability and ergonomics; a brief history of the technology; some elemental patterns of use; prototyping and documenting; and how to communicate that a gestural interface is present to users.</p></blockquote></p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/omnigraffle-sketch-style-screencast/">OmniGraffle Sketch Style Screencast</a></h2>
    <section class="article-body"><p><div class="video"><embed src="http://blip.tv/play/gatZ6cM_AA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="610" height="475" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></div>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting for the past year or so to do sketch style wireframes in OmniGraffle. My first requests for sketchy line styles were made to OmniGroup in the Spring of 08 along with a few other users, and I <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/omnigraffle-users/2007/004516.html">posted this comment to the OG List</a> about this feature. I knew how to do this in Visio, and had read that CAD users have something called a &ldquo;Jitter&rdquo; line style, so I quietly campaigned for this feature. </p>
<p>Balsamiq launched, and I love it, and would use it in the right circumstances. But I still use OG for documents, so I felt in between places, and unsure how to bring that unrefined look into my UI prototypes. Then David at Design Commission told me about a <a href="http://www.designcommission.com/blog/making-wireframes-look-sketchy/">method he uses</a> to make sketchy wireframes in OG by exporting into Illustrator and importing back into OmniGraffle. David was definitely onto something there.</p>
<p>Today I figured I would play a little bit with the drawing tools in OG. Just because no one knew how to tell me how to do sketch style in OG, didn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do it. So I looked at my tools. The pen tool is a tool (keyboard shortcut &ldquo;e&rdquo;) I use to make irregularly shaped objects. I&rsquo;m sure very few people use it. I knew that I could make curves and shapes with oddly placed anchor points with it. I also knew that you could add anchor points to regular shapes like elipses, circles, rectangles by making them editable, and then command double clicking on their lines.</p>
<p>Today I had my Eureka moment as I was walking down to Dumbo. I thought, &ldquo;What the hell, why don&rsquo;t I just add points to squares and move them around?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know how I could have missed that as a possible method. So I quickly put together the screencast above. Sorry about the poor audio quality. I was in a huge room with lots of people around talking while I recorded. </p>
<p>I really think OmniGroup could do a better job at explaining their software. If I worked there, I&rsquo;d be doing screencasts like this all the time. I do a pretty regular job answering readers&rsquo; and friends&rsquo; questions about OmniGraffle. </p>
<p>Some of you may already know this, but I&rsquo;ve been planning on writing and ebook for a long time now&ndash;one that helps you get the most of OmniGraffle. I think it&rsquo;s often dismissed as being too light or whatever, but believe me, there is a lot this thing can do. Sadly, some of these things aren&rsquo;t well documented, and probably many of the uses and applications we&rsquo;ve come up with were not predicted by OmniGroup. So I feel like it&rsquo;s up to me start showing others publicly what I&rsquo;ve been playing at rather than doing it on a one to one basis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going on vacation in a week and am taking my netbook with me to get ideas organized. Over the past year or so, I&rsquo;d been outlining all of the advanced features I use in the event that I could find time to publish them in a useful manner. I feel like that time has come, so while I&rsquo;m away, I&rsquo;m going to start the work of looking at what I&rsquo;ve got so far, and preparing to write. Stay tuned.</p></p>
