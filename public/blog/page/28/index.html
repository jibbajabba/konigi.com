  <section class="article-body"><p>Cartoon Network are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN1640720920080417?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;sp=true">building a new online gaming community</a> that hopes to challenge the model of the Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) with FusionFall, a game that leverages a community of players, but doesn't require the long term buildup of skillsets and earned resources. </p>
<blockquote><p>We're not building a game for hardcore gamers who will spend 60-plus hours a week here. If you think of those as hour-long dramas on TV, we want to be the half-hour sitcom. All of our missions are built in a way that they can be completed in 30 minutes at most. That get-in-and-get-out style of play is what makes casual gaming so popular, and we hope it is what will make 'FusionFall' popular.</p></blockquote>
<p>The game producers are hoping to capitalize on what they see as a growing interest in casual gaming, by providing a space that appeals to gamers who want bite-sized gameplay inside a more collaborative gaming space. The audience for this game are the youngsters who might now play Club Penguin, Habbo Hotel, and Runescape.</p>
<p>The Reuters article writes that the release of the game has been delayed to Fall because the producers won't release it until it's ready, citing the depth that has to be developed to get the experience right.</p>

The localization effort is a massive crowdsourcing task that has been both criticized and lauded. The critics often point to the unpredictability and inconsistency of translations.

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/bill-buxton-innovation-and-long-nose-theory/">Bill Buxton on Innovation and the Long Nose Theory</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://boltpeters.com/blog/?p=31"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt48079d9619afd.jpg"/></a></div><p>Bolt|Peters <a href="http://boltpeters.com/blog/?p=31">summarizes Bill Buxton&rsquo;s talk</a> at CHI 2008, which is focussed largely around his <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jan2008/id2008012_297369.htm">theory of long nose</a>. The article in BusinessWeek describes the danger of trying to innovate around the long tail theory alone, and attempts to create awareness for this other phenomenon which he calls the long nose. The theory describes how the bulk of innovation is low-amplitude and takes place over a long period of time. </p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he bulk of innovation behind the latest &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moment (multi-touch on the iPhone, for example) is also low-amplitude and takes place over a long period—but well before the &ldquo;new&rdquo; idea has become generally known, much less reached the tipping point.</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of the long, often slow process of arriving at that critical point of acceptance or realization, Buxton referenced in his Chi talk the work of Benvenuto Cellini. Cellini was an Italian Renaissance painter and craftsman who, Buxton pointed out, worked on a single sculpture over the course of seven years. By craft, he wasn&rsquo;t a sculptor, but he was able to invest in this long term engagement, driven by a heady pursuit that ended in the creation of a masterpiece, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:PerseusSignoriaStatue.jpg">Perseus with the Head of Medusa</a></i>.</p>
<p>Buxton&rsquo;s long nose theory asks us to focus on refining existing tools as much as creating new ones. He also reminds us to recall and understand the history of what has been done in the past. This knowledge of the history of design, and the refinement of those ideas, he argues, is what leads to the acceptance of innovation. </p>
<p>To make this point, he references the Marcel Proust quote below when he discusses his tongue-in-cheek press release calling the iPhone a re-release of the Newton:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The only true voyage of discovery is not to go to new places, but to have other eyes.” Basically, you don’t transform things by doing them from scratch, but by seeing them through different eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>His point here is that the lessons learned and the refinement of ideas introduced in the Newton years ago, and in the research on input devices and touch screens must have certainly played a part in the evolution of ideas leading to the iPhone. This was a slow evolution, and not an overnight innovation.</p>
<p>Buxton also references the 30 year history of the introduction of the idea of the mouse with Doug Englebart&rsquo;s 1965 demonstration to the broad acceptance of the input device in the mainstream when Microsoft released Windows 95. He goes on to say that this length of time is common&ndash;that any technological innovation &ldquo;that is going to have significant impact over the next 10 years is already at least 10 years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final message of the long nose is that refinement, not invention, is the bulk of the work and creativity required for innovation.</p></p>

The site puts you into the movie as though you are watching video captured from an observer who is actually in the scene. There&rsquo;s a qality to the video and the storytelling here that feels very reminiscent of the <i>Blair Witch Project</i>, and here it is an equally successful vehicle. </p>
<p>After exploring and experiencing some of the terror for a few minutes, check out the video footage of <a href="http://www.recmovie.co.uk/flash/#/menu/preview_clips/audience_reaction">audience reactions</a> at a screening of the film. </p></p>

<blockquote><p>According to the report, most individuals don‘t see most ads served to them—especially ads served below the fold. Despite this result, media delivery reports rarely include information on whether, or what percentage of, a media buy was served above or below the fold. On the chart below, the bottom of the blue area represents the percent of total viewers who see an ad; the top represents the percent of total viewers who scroll to a point where the ad is visible on their screen. Clearly, just being above the fold makes a huge difference.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The article apparently discusses the misunderstanding of the term collaboration, and when it is an appropriate practice. There may be some definition of the subtle nuances of the tools for knowledge work here that should be interesting to those involved with social software and km.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/flickr-video/">Flickr Video!</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p><div class="notebook-screenshot"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/video/"><img src="http://media.konigi.com/bluga/wt47fd898cdfc24.jpg"/></a></div><p>Flickr <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/04/09/video-on-flickr-2/">have announced</a> that they are now letting Pro account users post video up to 90 seconds to their accounts. An invitation only group called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/video/">Video! Video! Video!</a> was created to showcase some of this new content. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to post small videos to my Flickr account. I&rsquo;ve always loved that my digital cameras limit me to capturing only the short moments. In a way, it reminds me of haiku, in that is forced to create poetry within the constraints and rules of the format. Within the confines of those limited spaces, some very interesting things often emerge.</p>
<p>In the years that I&rsquo;ve used Flickr, I&rsquo;ve noticed creative people using the site to express themselves in ways perhaps unintended and unimagined by the creators. I think the long awaited introduction of video will be no different. Sure, there will be people who post content that is less than artistic or interesting. But, I&rsquo;m hoping you&rsquo;ll see a different kind of video quality here than you see on YouTube, because of the constraints of the 90 second limit. Only time will tell. For now, I&rsquo;m anxious to see what is generated in these early postings.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a very small sample video I posted so you can see the video player in action. Looks like I might have to start shooting larger video shorts now. I might also start doing the UI screencasts in Flickr rather than Vimeo.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/2-month-review/">2 Month Review</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>This is a late 2 month review on the progress developing this blog. In the past couple of weeks, I was finishing off my last days at my job, and I'm now preparing to move on to a new position as Director of UX at a software development company.</p>
<p>February was about getting the site up as quickly as possible and bootstrapping by experimenting with some content creation to fill out the sections. March was about assessing where the implementation had gone, focussing on the things that work, and stripping out the things that didn't work. So here's where we netted out:</p>
<ol>
<li>The theme design was fussy and got in the way of the content. It's been stripped down to the bare essentials. </li>
<li>Part of minimizing the theme design was to simplify the header so that the content moved higher up the page. The navigation header now acts as a sort of breadcrumb once you've drilled down beneath the home page.</li>
<li>The IA changed slightly. I found that while I like the format of the 3x2 and 3x3 mosaics of screenshots I do on featured designs, I post more of the non-featured designs daily when I'm surfing the web. So I've made the default Design page a roll-up of both featured and non-featured, and simply tack a "star badge" on the items that have that special mosaic of screenshots. I do the same thing on the home page, showing the featured designs and interfaces with this red badge.</li>
<li>Stripped out rating from the entries. Not sure yet if this is the right decision, but I find ratings to be problematic if they don't provide some incentive back to the individual. The only thing I can provide at the moment is recommendations for highest rated entries, but nothing more sophisticated than that without custom programming (which I cannot do).</li>
<li>The submissions process I had come up with wasn't working for me, so I have decided that all the designs and interfaces that make it to those main sections will be only those that I create. To submit designs and interfaces, registered users will now use the links to post notebook entries that are tagged either "design" or "interface." I will feature the best of those submissions. Anonymous posting is now only permitted in comments.</li>
<li>RSS feeds were beefed up with images.</li>
<li>Feedburner newsletter was set up.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the April-May timeframe I'll be mainly focusing on featured interfaces a bit more, including doing a little research on a feature I'm going to add to deepen the usefulness of that section. </p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/2387495926/" title="the Geniant blog — The Fine Art of Wireframes by jibbajabba, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2243/2387495926_b27d509a62_o.png" alt="the Geniant blog — The Fine Art of Wireframes" class="notebook-image" /></a></p>
<p>On the Geniant blog, T.Scott Stromberg <a href="http://geniantsandbox.com/2008/02/28/the-fine-art-of-wireframes">exposes his craft of wireframe sketching</a>. I also spend most of my ideation time sketching. It's lovely to see other people's methods for getting ideas down. I love Stromberg's comments and comic book style.</p>
<p>This might sound kind of pathetic, but seeing the pens and paper he uses is the kind of thing I really geek out on. I love that he's pimping out the <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Dot-Grid-Book/9">Behance dot grid pads</a>. A designer gave me a pad of that stuff recently after I got him a leatherette <a href="http://www.vickerey.com/rhodia.html">Rhodia 3x4 case</a>. I carry one of those with me everywhere with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Twist-Erase-Automatic-Pencil-Black/dp/B00006IEH2/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1207312018&amp;sr=1-10">Pentel  .7mm pencil</a>. When I sit down to work on a large project, though, I use the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters">Tufte 11x17 graph paper</a>, with the Pentel and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pigma-Micron-Pens-6-pk%252e/dp/B0008G8G8Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=office-products&amp;qid=1207312148&amp;sr=1-1">Micron</a>. I have to agree with his method of inking the sketches. I've gotten accustomed to doing that when I have to scan sketches to send to people, and tracing is something I'm used to doing from comic book sketching. </p>
<p>Another option to consider in a pinch, or if you can't stand to buy expensive paper, is to <a href="http://incompetech.com/graphpaper/plain/">print your own graph paper</a> with the graph paper pdf generator or download <a href="http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072532947/student_view0/grid_and_dot_paper.html">grid and graph paper from McGraw Higher Ed.</a> Will do paper up to 11 x 17 and lets you specify line weight and color. </p>
<p>I also created 2 different grid paper templates you can use. Download the PDFs at <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/notebook/8-5_x_11_grid_paper.pdf">8.5" x 11"</a> or <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/konigi/notebook/11_x_17_grid_paper.pdf">11" x 17"</a> that you can download.</p>
<p><small>Thanks, <a href="http://incsub.org/soulsoup/?p=997">Soul Soup</a>, for the link to Stromberg's article.</small></p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/screen-resolution-statistics/">Screen Resolution Statistics</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>When it comes to researching user's screen resolution, I'm a strong believer that vertical positioning matters most when considering key issues such as location of identifying elements like site name and h1-type headings, and elements that satisfy business rules such as ad location. The B&amp;A article, <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/blasting-the-myth-of">"Blasting the Myth of the Fold"</a> addresses this issue well, and I'm in agreement that "the fold" matters little if the above issues are dealt with. But the issue of browser width is still one that is heavily dependent on audience, and knowledge of what your web analytics tool records about actual users.</p>
<p>When you have a site that has not gone public yet, however, you will have the need to address the issue of resolution in the absence of real data for your site. So where do we turn? We benchmark. Here are a few of my sources for researching this kind of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with sites that provide a log analysis service across a broad range of sites and publish their aggregated stats. Example services that provide this data include <a href="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2008/February/res.php">The Counter</a>, <a href="http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php">W3Counter</a>, and <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=17">Net Applications</a>.</li>
<li>Compare for sanity against individual sites, especially other sites in your industry, or sites you may already publish. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp">W3Schools</a> publishes their stats, for instance, but that audience is heavily skewed towards technical users.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have to provide a few sites as a benchmark sources like these may be helpful. Base your browser width decisions on your understanding of who will be accessing your site, just as you would consider user research when deciding what features to provide in your product.</p>
<p><small>For a bit of information about the estimates you get from aggregated sources, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">this Wikipedia entry on Usage of Web Browsers</a>.</small></p>

  <section class="article-body"><p>Sorry for the lull in activity this past few weeks. I'm doing my last days at my current job and getting ready to transition to a new gig in a week.</p>
<p>After the last 2 months with this site, I've assessed some of the functionality I went out with, and am doing some cleanup. I launched with all the blades out and am now pulling them back in to only expose the essentials. The goal will be to simplify the navigation, and let the screenshots take prominence. There will be some reconfiguring of database searches and sort options as well, now that I've found what the typical flow will be for this site. I'm also going to remove the design/interface submission options for now, and may go another direction with regard to that.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now, I've stripped out the graphics and will get a slightly more low-fi design up in the next few weeks.</p>

This has been on my to do list, but I finally got off my ass and spent a couple hours this morning figuring how to get Drupal to do it after <a href="../design/submissions/artgeex.html">a user made some demands</a>. There are a bunch of things that aren't working for me on this site that I plan to fix, but I went with the idea of getting things up fast versus getting them out right. The experience will get better over time, I promise.  </p>
<p>For the record, I don't plan to implement every suggestion that comes along, but this has been on my list. If you do have suggestions, please do make them, but know that I'm more receptive to a friendly tone.</p>

<p>I updated the <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/personal/resources/omnigraffle_web_design_template">OmniGraffle Web Design Template</a>.</p>
<p>This web design template is for people who do wireframes and storyboards. The template was created for OmniGraffle Professional provides the basic layout for a design deliverable including the following master canvases: document title, section title, wireframe (portrait and landscape), storyboard, and blank. The wireframes were created at 950px wide with guides following the Blueprint CSS Grid system. Wireframes also have 2 small hairline marks around the 600px point to mark the approximate fold. Go <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/personal/resources/omnigraffle_web_design_template">grab it here</a>.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?661">Luke Wroblewski summarizes</a> the fundamental principles that guide Google in designing user experiences, as <a href="http://www.writersua.com/ohc/track1.htm#session22">told by John Wiley</a> in a WritersUA presentation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Useful: focus on people -their lives, their work, their dreams.</li>
<li>Fast: every millisecond counts</li>
<li>Simple: simplicity is powerful.</li>
<li>Engaging: engage beginners and attract experts.</li>
<li>Innovative: dare to be innovative.</li>
<li>Universal: design for the world.</li>
<li>Profitable: plan for today's and tomorrow's business.</li>
<li>Beautiful: delight the eye without distracting the mind.</li>
<li>Trustworthy: be worthy of people's trust.</li>
<li>Personable: add a human touch.</li>
</ol>

  <section class="article-body"><p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10804121">The Economist reports</a> on some research undertaken by Fang Wu and Bernardo Huberman, a pair of researchers at Hewlett-Packard&rsquo;s laboratory in Palo Alto, California, to compare two strategies used on news sites: one based on the previous popularity of a story, the other on its novelty. The researchers based their study on analysis of articles posted to digg, and the article provides some insight into the digg algorithm and the half-life of an entry (about 69 minutes before an entry gets demoted from the home page). </p>
<p>They summarize with some editorial advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hat it means in practice is that if you run a website, you would be wise to learn more about exactly how interest in your stories cools off, if you want to display those stories in a way that will entice the largest number of people to read them.</p></blockquote></p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/apples-design-process/">Apple&#39;s Design process</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>Michael Lopp, Senior Engineering Manager at Apple discussed Apple's design process at a presentation given at SXSW. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_p.html">Business Week summarized the points</a>, excerpted below. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Pixel Perfect Mockups</strong><br />
This, Lopp admitted, causes a huge amount of work and takes an enormous amount of time. But, he added, “it removes all ambiguity.” That might add time up front, but it removes the need to correct mistakes later on.</p>
<p><strong>10 to 3 to 1</strong><br />
Apple designers come up with 10 entirely different mock ups of any new feature. Not, Lopp said, "seven in order to make three look good", which seems to be a fairly standard practice elsewhere. They'll take ten, and give themselves room to design without restriction. Later they whittle that number to three, spend more months on those three and then finally end up with one strong decision.</p>
<p><strong>Paired Design Meetings</strong><br />
This was really interesting. Every week, the teams have two meetings. One in which to brainstorm, to forget about constraints and think freely. As Lopp put it: to "go crazy". Then they also hold a production meeting, an entirely separate but equally regular meeting which is the other's antithesis. Here, the designers and engineers are required to nail everything down, to work out how this crazy idea might actually work. This process and organization continues throughout the development of any app, though of course the balance shifts as the app progresses. But keeping an option for creative thought even at a late stage is really smart.</p>
<p><strong>Pony Meeting</strong><br />
This refers to a story Lopp told earlier in the session, in which he described the process of a senior manager outlining what they wanted from any new application: "I want WYSIWYG... I want it to support major browsers... I want it to reflect the spirit of the company." Or, as Lopp put it: "I want a pony!" He added: "Who doesn't? A pony is gorgeous!" The problem, he said, is that these people are describing what they think they want. And even if they're misguided, they, as the ones signing the checks, really cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The solution, he described, is to take the best ideas from the paired design meetings and present those to leadership, who might just decide that some of those ideas are, in fact, their longed-for ponies. In this way, the ponies morph into deliverables. And the C-suite, who are quite reasonable in wanting to know what designers are up to, and absolutely entitled to want to have a say in what's going on, are involved and included. And that helps to ensure that there are no nasty mistakes down the line.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this article, I heard someone in my office referring to dream features as ponies.</p>

  <section class="article-body"><p><img src="http://urlgreyhot.com/files/illustrator/blueprint-comp-ai.png" class="notebook-image" /><br />
I've created Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator templates for creating comps that work with Olav Bjorkoy's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS Framework</a>. The templates are simply documents with guides based on the 24 units provided by Blueprint. The background image of the grid is also provided with a layer to show unit numbers if you like, and the Illustrator document shows a fake comp to demonstrate positioning on the grid.</p>
<p>You may download the templates here:</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://konigi.com/blog/1-month-review/">1 month review</a></h2>
  <section class="article-body"><p>So it's about 1 month after I officially launched this site. If you were with me when it first went up, you may have noticed a few minor changes. I started out getting as many things up as I could, and am now evaluating the effectivenes of some decisions and simplifying. Some of the issues around changes have to do with figuring out what works best, others are based on issues having to do with services. </p>
<p>Most notable changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I turned off <strong>design submissions</strong> temporarily because the screenshot service I was using ceased to function. Am considering now just allowing the submission pool to exist, but there will only be screenshots on hover using the Snap.com service.</li>
<li>I turned on <strong>interface submissions</strong>. This requires that you take a screenshot with a tool of your choice (I would recommend <a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch</a> or <a href="http://www.jingproject.com/">Jing</a>) and posting it to the pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upcoming changes in March-April timeframe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatting content to put out <strong>complete RSS feeds with images</strong>. Requires doing some views work on Drupal with my custom content types.</li>
<li><strong>Feedburner email newsletter</strong> with full content in the feed including a preview of submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now. I know that posting is slow, but it's regular. I'm trying to emphasize the curative nature of this site rather than going for volume. Everyone else does the volume posting well.</p>
