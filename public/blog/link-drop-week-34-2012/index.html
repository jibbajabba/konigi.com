<li><a href="http://feltpresence.com/articles/17-keeping-the-goal-in-sight-while-designing-component-flows" class="ttl">Keeping the goal in sight while designing component flows - (Ryan Singer)</a> Ryan Singer looks at a product component that fails to deliver on satisfying a user's core need, and reminds not to design and reviewing components in isolation. Every build and iteration requires review and circling back to evaluate the component in terms of the need identified in the use case scenario. Put into action, he says:<br />
How do we integrate the components back into a context for review? Ask the question: “What is the user trying to do here?” The job the user has in mind is the best integration point because the user’s mind doesn’t tidily follow the boundaries of implementation.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665022/why-does-interaction-design-matter-lets-look-at-the-evolving-subway-experience" class="ttl">Why Does Interaction Design Matter? Let's Look At The Evolving Subway Experience | Co.Design: business + innovation + design</a> Robert Fabricant looks at the ways interaction design has had an impact on the MTA/NYC subway system from the Metrocard kiosks and turnstiles, to the signage and app ecosystem that enable better wayfinding and information use in what can be an overwhelmingly complex system to navigate. Also touches on the IXDA awards.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/everything-in-its-right-pace/" class="ttl">Everything in its Right&nbsp;Pace</a> This is a terrific essay on considering the pace of delivery of information in web products, and how in a world of constant delivery, sometimes a slower pace, selective or scant data delivery, and better signal to noise is more appropriate and valuable in a given context.</li>
<li><a href="http://baymard.com/blog/visually-reinforce-sensitive-fields" class="ttl">Visually Reinforce Your Credit Card Fields (89% Get it Wrong) - Articles - Baymard Institute</a> "It’s fortunately a relatively simple procedure to lift the perceived security of sensitive fields in your form – simply encapsulate the fields with a border or background and place your security badge nearby."</li>
<li><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120731/apple-literally-designs-its-products-around-a-kitchen-table/" class="ttl">Apple Literally Designs Its Products Around a Kitchen Table</a> "Longtime Apple industrial designer Chris Stringer testified that the company has a small team of 15 or 16 people that fashion all of the company’s products. The group meets frequently, literally sitting around a kitchen table, to debate all products under development. “We’ll sit there with our sketch books and trade ideas,” Stringer said, appearing as the first witness in the Apple vs. Samsung trial. “That’s where the really hard, brutal honest criticism comes in.”<br />
From there, the group puts the sketches into a computer-aided design program and, if warranted, creates a physical model. “Our role is to imagine products that don’t exist and guide them to life,” Stringer said. There could be 50 designs for a single button, he added. “We’re a pretty maniacal group of people,” he said."</li>
