      <description>These are some of the quotes I&#39;ve collected from artists and designers that have some relevance to doing business in web and software product design.

Art and Design Movie Quotes
I&#39;ve made it a habit to try and find documentaries about an art/craft to watch whenever I fly, so it made sense to take notes as I would in my journal and put them up here for inspiration. You&#39;ll find quotes from the following movies here:</description>

      <description>I started keeping a journal in 2011 about a personal project I had undertaken towards simplifying aspects of my life. The impetus came after downsizing homes, having children, and realizing that things I had accumulated began to require more space, maintenance, and attention than I was willing to give. Possessing things began to cost more than the enjoyment they provided in return.
I, with my taste for electronics, hand-crafted goods, and toys, have not always found it easy to let go of things.</description>

      <description>My analog tools don&#39;t change much. I&#39;ve bought many, but in reality I use only a handful. These are the ones I now stick with.
 Sketching Pens and Markers  PIlot Hi-Tec-C 0.4mm (black)
This is the black gel pen I carry in my pocket. Always with me, and unforgivingly hard and fine. It&#39;s my preferred tool for small thumbnail sketching in my pocket sketchbook and on my 8-up sheets, where I work in small areas on mostly abstract boxes and arrows.</description>

      <description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description>

      <description>This is a small journal and mini book about the approach I take when sketching for interface and interaction design. I&#39;m writing this as I enter what I think may be my 17th year making web sites. The only thing I can say with each passing year is that what I know is still so very little compared to what I have yet to learn. Each time I learn of a new way of working I feel energized and excited about the work I do.</description>

      <description>Ping, ping, ping. Software should stay out of the way so I can get stuff done.
I have trouble focusing on certain types of work and need to turn notifications off and use alarms and timers to stay on task. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my constant pursuit of focus. To give you an idea of how obsessive I am about this, take a look at what my desktop looks like. The desktop wallpaper is by Hector Simpson.</description>

      <description>Definitions Storyboarding is the technique interaction designers and information architects have adopted from film and animation to specify interaction in user interfaces. Storyboards in interaction design typically show a sequence of key frames that depict when a change in state occurs in the interface. They are often illustrated with a linear, multi-cell diagram, often accompanied by annotations to describe the actions taken by the user, and the responses or behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>Definitions &amp;ldquo;Concept design is an early phase of the design process that explores far-ranging design ideas which are plausible but which often set aside immediate technical and situational constraints in order to generate new options. The results can be seen in the concept cars from Pininfarina, the futuristic structures rendered by Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, and the Christian Lacroix designs on the runways of Paris.&amp;rdquo;

      <guid>http://konigi.com/articles/dark-patterns/</guid>
      <description>Definitions Dark Patterns are interface design patterns that have been designed to trick users into doing things they wouldn’t otherwise have done.
The term was coined by Harry Brignull, who writes on DarkPatterns.org, that they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. In the talk Brignull gave at UX Brighton 2010, he calls for a code of ethics among professionals in the user interface design industries, and for professional associations to acknowledge that these practices are unethical.</description>

      <description>About Web accessibility Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users can have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large and/or enlargable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content.</description>

      <description>Definitions A wireframe is a schematic or other low-fidelity rendering of a computer interface, intended to primarily demonstrate functionality, features, content, and user flow without explicitly specifying the visual design of a product. Wireframes may function as interface specification for products such as computer applications, web and mobile sites, and all products requiring some form of human-computer interaction. While wireframes are considered the equivalent of an architect&amp;rsquo;s blueprints, they are typically not meant to be a representation of visual design.</description>

      <description>The page description diagram is a design artifact developed by Dan Brown to take design out of wireframes by describing content areas of the page. The approach provides functional specifications and interaction requirements, and lays out blocks of content without limiting the designer&#39;s ability to make decisions in the visual design. They are not necessarily meant to replace wireframes, but may be used in conjunction with them

      <description>Definition Heuristic evaluation is a discount usability engineering method for quick, cheap, and easy evaluation of a user interface design.
Heuristic evaluation is the most popular of the usability inspection methods. Heuristic evaluation is done as a systematic inspection of a user interface design for usability. The goal of heuristic evaluation is to find the usability problems in the design so that they can be attended to as part of an iterative design process.</description>

      <description>About User Experience Design in the Agile Software Development method and Agile Process.
Agile Method Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.
Agile methods generally promote a project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices that allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals.</description>

      <description>Goal Directed Design is an interaction design methodology created by Cooper that identifies the goals and behaviors of users, and the goals of a business, and directly translates these into design.
The process is broken down into the following steps, according to the process page on the Cooper site.
 Project Planning  Research  Modeling  Requirements  Framework  Refinement  Support  A more detailed description of the tasks associated with this process are described in &amp;quot;Goal-Directed Design: An Interview with Kim Goodwin,&amp;quot; by Christine Perfetti on the User Interface Engineering site.</description>

      <description>Method Iterative design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability testing is the measurement of the usability of a product or service. The definition from usability.gov succinctly describes the process.
In a usability test, representative users try to do typical tasks with the product, while observers, including the development staff, watch, listen, and take notes. The product can be a Web site, Web application, or any other product. It does not have to be a finished product. You should be testing prototypes from early paper-based stages through fully functional later stages.</description>

[O]n an individual basis our definitions and descriptions of what constitutes a “prototype” vary greatly. Prototypes have been described as hi-fidelity, lo-fidelity, functional, nonfunctional, paper, Flash®, HTML, interactive, non-interactive, click-through, garden variety walk-through, cognitive walk-through—the list just keeps going.
...
When I refer to a prototype, I&#39;m referring to something that, from my book, &amp;quot;regardless of its fidelity, functionality, or how it’s made, a prototype is a conceptual model that captures and communicates the vision, intent, or idea of a design.</description>

      <description>Definition A method of low cost usability engineering proposed by Jakob Nielsen that asserts that usability that is performed frequently with fewer participants, and using scenario based observation yields results that are nearly as good, and with better ROI when compared with costlier traditional usability testing.
Ergosoft Laboratories summarizes the method:
The primary characteristics of discount usability engineering are small sample sizes (i.e., fewer participants), frequent iterations of these small tests, and reliance on direct observations rather than on statistically established findings.</description>

      <description>Definition Usability is an approach to product development that incorporates direct user feedback throughout the development cycle in order to reduce costs and create products and tools that meet user needs. There are many definitions of usability from books by usability professionals.
Two international standards define usability and human-centered (or user-centered) design:
&amp;quot;[Usability refers to] the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.</description>

      <description>Definitions A pattern describes an optimal solution to a common problem within a specific context.
From the IAWiki:
 Patterns are optimal solutions to common problems. As common problems are tossed around a community and are resolved, common solutions often spontaneously emerge. Eventually, the best of these rise above the din and self-identify and become refined until they reach the status of a Design Pattern.  Each pattern has four primary components:</description>

      <description>Definitions User Experience &amp;quot;User Experience (abbreviated: UX) is the quality of experience a person has when interacting with a specific design. This can range from a specific artifact, such as a cup, toy or website, up to larger, integrated experiences such as a museum or an airport.&amp;quot;
Sources: UX Net, Interaction-Design.org
&amp;quot;&#39;User experience&#39; encompasses all aspects of the end-user&#39;s interaction with the company, its services, and its products. The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother.</description>
