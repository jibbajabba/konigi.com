      <description>These are some of the quotes I&#39;ve collected from artists and designers that have some relevance to doing business in web and software product design.

Art and Design Movie Quotes
I&#39;ve made it a habit to try and find documentaries about an art/craft to watch whenever I fly, so it made sense to take notes as I would in my journal and put them up here for inspiration. You&#39;ll find quotes from the following movies here:</description>

      <description>I started keeping a journal in 2011 about a personal project I had undertaken towards simplifying aspects of my life. The impetus came after downsizing homes, having children, and realizing that things I had accumulated began to require more space, maintenance, and attention than I was willing to give. Possessing things began to cost more than the enjoyment they provided in return.
I, with my taste for electronics, hand-crafted goods, and toys, have not always found it easy to let go of things.</description>

      <description>My analog tools don&#39;t change much. I&#39;ve bought many, but in reality I use only a handful. These are the ones I now stick with.
 Sketching Pens and Markers  PIlot Hi-Tec-C 0.4mm (black)
This is the black gel pen I carry in my pocket. Always with me, and unforgivingly hard and fine. It&#39;s my preferred tool for small thumbnail sketching in my pocket sketchbook and on my 8-up sheets, where I work in small areas on mostly abstract boxes and arrows.</description>

      <title>Learn to Code</title>

      <description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description>

      <description>Definition A research technique for learning whether people notice key elements in your design.

      <description>This is a small journal and mini book about the approach I take when sketching for interface and interaction design. I&#39;m writing this as I enter what I think may be my 17th year making web sites. The only thing I can say with each passing year is that what I know is still so very little compared to what I have yet to learn. Each time I learn of a new way of working I feel energized and excited about the work I do.</description>

      <description>Ping, ping, ping. Software should stay out of the way so I can get stuff done.
I have trouble focusing on certain types of work and need to turn notifications off and use alarms and timers to stay on task. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my constant pursuit of focus. To give you an idea of how obsessive I am about this, take a look at what my desktop looks like. The desktop wallpaper is by Hector Simpson.</description>

      <description>Definitions Storyboarding is the technique interaction designers and information architects have adopted from film and animation to specify interaction in user interfaces. Storyboards in interaction design typically show a sequence of key frames that depict when a change in state occurs in the interface. They are often illustrated with a linear, multi-cell diagram, often accompanied by annotations to describe the actions taken by the user, and the responses or behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>Definition Lorem Ipsum refers to the meaningless text used as placeholder or filler in visual design to suggest where text should be placed for layout. Other terms for this filler include Greeking, Placeholder Text, and Dummy Text. The text starting &amp;quot;Lorem ipsum dolor...&amp;quot; was traditionally a Latin passage by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin.

      <description>Definitions &#34;Concept design is an early phase of the design process that explores far-ranging design ideas which are plausible but which often set aside immediate technical and situational constraints in order to generate new options. The results can be seen in the concept cars from Pininfarina, the futuristic structures rendered by Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, and the Christian Lacroix designs on the runways of Paris.&#34;

      <guid>http://konigi.com/articles/dark-patterns/</guid>
      <description>Definitions Dark Patterns are interface design patterns that have been designed to trick users into doing things they wouldn’t otherwise have done.
The term was coined by Harry Brignull, who writes on DarkPatterns.org, that they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interests in mind. In the talk Brignull gave at UX Brighton 2010, he calls for a code of ethics among professionals in the user interface design industries, and for professional associations to acknowledge that these practices are unethical.</description>
