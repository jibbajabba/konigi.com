Art and Design Movie Quotes
I've made it a habit to try and find documentaries about an art/craft to watch whenever I fly, so it made sense to take notes as I would in my journal and put them up here for inspiration. You'll find quotes from the following movies here:</description></item><item><title>Go Light</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/go-light/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/go-light/</guid><description>I started keeping a journal in 2011 about a personal project I had undertaken towards simplifying aspects of my life. The impetus came after downsizing homes, having children, and realizing that things I had accumulated began to require more space, maintenance, and attention than I was willing to give. Possessing things began to cost more than the enjoyment they provided in return.
I, with my taste for electronics, hand-crafted goods, and toys, have not always found it easy to let go of things.</description></item><item><title>Analog Tools</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/analog-tools/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/analog-tools/</guid><description>My analog tools don't change much. I've bought many, but in reality I use only a handful. These are the ones I now stick with.
Sketching Pens and Markers PIlot Hi-Tec-C 0.4mm (black)
This is the black gel pen I carry in my pocket. Always with me, and unforgivingly hard and fine. It's my preferred tool for small thumbnail sketching in my pocket sketchbook and on my 8-up sheets, where I work in small areas on mostly abstract boxes and arrows.</description></item><item><title>Learn to Code</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/learn-code/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/learn-code/</guid><description>The Debate The debate about whether or not designers need to learn to code is essentially about knowing enough HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript to be able to prototype web views.
Mastery and the ability to produce production code is not something most interaction designers and information architects will have the opportunity to achieve, but being capable enough to communicate design on web products requires some basic skills that you can learn in a few days or months to start.</description></item><item><title>Noticeability Evaluation</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/noticeability-evaluation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/noticeability-evaluation/</guid><description>Definition A research technique for learning whether people notice key elements in your design.
An exercise during which users are asked to re-create a screen based on their memory.
Source: &amp;quot;What UX Research Can You Do with 5 Users in 1 Hour?,&amp;quot; by Tomer Sharon. Asbury Agile 2012.
How to do it 1. Create an evaluation kit
Print any screen Cut the screen into elements (leave some out) Also print/cut some elements that weren't on the screen Mix the pieces up Sharpie and some extra paper 2.</description></item><item><title>The Sketch Book</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/sketch-book/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/sketch-book/</guid><description>This is a small journal and mini book about the approach I take when sketching for interface and interaction design. I'm writing this as I enter what I think may be my 17th year making web sites. The only thing I can say with each passing year is that what I know is still so very little compared to what I have yet to learn. Each time I learn of a new way of working I feel energized and excited about the work I do.</description></item><item><title>Glossaries</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/glossaries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/glossaries/</guid><description> Experience Design Glossary.

Software should stay out of the way so I can get stuff done.
I have trouble focusing on certain types of work and need to turn notifications off and use alarms and timers to stay on task. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about my constant pursuit of focus. To give you an idea of how obsessive I am about this, take a look at what my desktop looks like. The desktop wallpaper is by Hector Simpson.</description></item><item><title>Storyboards</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/storyboards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/storyboards/</guid><description>Definitions Storyboarding is the technique interaction designers and information architects have adopted from film and animation to specify interaction in user interfaces. Storyboards in interaction design typically show a sequence of key frames that depict when a change in state occurs in the interface. They are often illustrated with a linear, multi-cell diagram, often accompanied by annotations to describe the actions taken by the user, and the responses or behavior of the system.</description></item><item><title>Interface and Interaction Notation</title><link>https://konigi.com/design/interface-and-interaction-notation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://konigi.com/design/interface-and-interaction-notation/</guid><description>About Resources for annotating interfaces and interaction.

Other terms for this filler include Greeking, Placeholder Text, and Dummy Text. The text starting &amp;quot;Lorem ipsum dolor...&amp;quot; was traditionally a Latin passage by Cicero with words altered, added and removed that make it nonsensical in meaning and not proper Latin.

The results can be seen in the concept cars from Pininfarina, the futuristic structures rendered by Rem Koolhaasâ€™s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, and the Christian Lacroix designs on the runways of Paris."

The term was coined by Harry Brignull, who writes on DarkPatterns.org, that they are carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the userâ€™s interests in mind. In the talk Brignull gave at UX Brighton 2010, he calls for a code of ethics among professionals in the user interface design industries, and for professional associations to acknowledge that these practices are unethical.</description></item></channel></rss>
