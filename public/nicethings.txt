<hr/>

<p>Konigi is a *fantastic* resource for every User Interface Designer.<br />

<p>It’s perfect for those times when you’re designing a feature and you want to review all the prior art. It’s worth keeping an eye on.<br />

<p>One source I love for examples of successful interface and visual design is konigi.com. Rather than focusing on an entire site or application, they just highlight out individual nuggets of gold.<br />

<p>I think its a brilliant Idea. I am pretty sure the big game changer designs will be inspired from R&amp;D on this website.<br />
