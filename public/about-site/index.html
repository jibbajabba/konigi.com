  <h2 class="post-title">About This Site</h2>
  <section class="article-body"><div class="column span-18">
<p class="dek">Konigi is about shared knowledge and influence.</p>
<p>The idea of researching how others have designed the look and feel of web sites and crafted their user interfaces is a practice many of us are engaged in continually. We may monitor innovative designers and the sites of influence that have paved the way for the practices we engage in as user experience and visual designers. In a way, it allows us to remain competitive to know what others are up to, but that awareness alone can be a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>As much as this kind of research is essential, there is also danger in getting lazy and merely copying design patterns or practices established on influential sites, making the argument that we're following agreed upon conventions or best practices in the name of usability or worse, novelty. I have a bit of fear in starting this kind of site for this reason. Ever since I started working in this industry, I've maintained swipe files or bookmarks at various places to track the sites that have left an impression with me. But over time, I began to wonder if doing this type of research with the intention of influencing your own work positively might subconsciously affect the work in ways I don't necessarily want. Even when you set out not to copy what others do, the awareness of what they've done may, in a sense, negatively influence by hampering innovation. So with this in mind, I publicly add this warning to myself as I begin to chronicle the evolution of web user experiences even more rigorously here. </p>
<p>While this site may be used for the purpose of stealing or copying others' ideas, I implore you, dear reader, not to. There is a difference between being influenced and merely copying. My original intent here was to begin to compare innovative design solutions against conventional ones, with the goal of merely acquainting you with the creators of these user experiences. I hope this site succeeds in providing that perspective, but only time will tell if I am able to do that. </p>
<p>My goal in all of this is to prove the point that design patterns are nice, but innovation for the sake of improving contextual experience is better. This site is also about demonstrating the idea that not only is it our job to give users what they expect and think they want, but more importantly it is to give them what they need and might not be able to express. I think some of the examples I showcase here do that exceptionally well.</p>
<p>I hope that you will let me know when you come across or create great web experiences, so they may be included among the excellent examples featured on this site.</p>

<h3>What people are saying...</h3>
<div class="t10">
<p>Konigi is a *fantastic* resource for every User Interface Designer.<br />
&#8212;<a href="http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2008/02/konigi.html">swissmiss</a></p>
<p>It’s perfect for those times when you’re designing a feature and you want to review all the prior art. It’s worth keeping an eye on.<br />
&#8212;<a href="http://noisebetweenstations.com/personal/weblogs/?p=2165">noise between stations</a></p>
<p>One source I love for examples of successful interface and visual design is konigi.com. Rather than focusing on an entire site or application, they just highlight out individual nuggets of gold.<br />
&#8212;<a href="http://sensinct.com/learning-by-example/">Sensinct</a></p>
<p>Konigi is a beautiful site chock full of inspiration for user experience designers.<br />

<p>I think its a brilliant Idea. I am pretty sure the big game changer designs will be inspired from R&amp;D on this website.<br />
