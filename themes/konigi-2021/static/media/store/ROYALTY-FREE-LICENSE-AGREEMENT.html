ROYALTY FREE LICENSE AGREEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------

This Agreement governs the terms by purchasers of Konigi Royalty Free
(RF) Licenses obtain the right to use media provided by Konigi.

In this Agreement: (i) "you" or the "Client" means you or, if you are
accepting on behalf of your employer or member account entity, then
"you" means that employer or entity and affiliates; (ii) "Konigi" or
"we" means Konigi, operator of the Site; and (iii) "Content" means any
image, illustration, file, visual representation generated optically,
electronically, digitally or by any other means or in any media or other
material that you are downloading from the Site, together with any
accompanying material. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Standard License Terms
--------------------------------------------------------------

We hereby grant to you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable
worldwide license to use the Content for the Permitted Uses (as defined
below). Unless the activity or use is a Permitted Use, you cannot do it.
All other rights in and to the Content, including, without limitation,
all copyright and other intellectual property rights relating to the
Content, are retained by Konigi.

--------------------------------------------------------------
2. Permitted Standard License Uses:
--------------------------------------------------------------

(a) You may only use the Content for those advertising, promotional and
other specified purposes which are Permitted Uses (as defined below).
For clarity, you may not use the Content in products for resale, license
or other distribution, unless (i) the proposed use is allowable under an
Extended License which is available for the Content; or (ii) if the
original Content have been fundamentally modified or transformed
sufficiently that it constitutes an original work entitling the author
or artist to copyright protection under applicable law, and where the
primary value of such transformed or derivative work is not recognizable
as the Content nor is the Content capable of being downloaded, extracted
or accessed by a third party as a stand-alone file (satisfaction of
these conditions will constitute the work as a "Permitted Derivative
Work" for the purposes of this Agreement). For example, you cannot
superficially modify the Content, print it on a t-shirt, mug, poster,
template or other item, and sell it to others for consumption,
reproduction or re-sale. These uses will not be permitted as or
constitute Permitted Derivative Works. If there is any doubt that a work
is a Permitted Derivative Work, you should either obtain an Extended
License or contact Konigi’s Client Relations for guidance. Any use of
the Content that is not a Permitted Use shall constitute infringement of
copyright.

(b) Seat Restrictions. Only you are permitted to use the Content,
although you may transfer files containing Content or Permitted
Derivative Works to your clients, printers, or ISP for the purpose of
reproduction for Permitted Uses, provided that such parties shall have
no further or additional rights to use the Content and cannot access or
extract it from any file you provide. You may install and use the
Content in only one location at a time, although subject to the
Prohibited Uses and the other terms of this Agreement, you are entitled
to utilize the Permitted Uses an unlimited number of times. You may
physically transfer the Content and its archives from one location to
another, in which case you may use the Content at the new location
instead. If you require the Content to be in more than one location or
accessible by more than one person, you must download the Content from
the Site for each such use or contact Konigi to obtain a multi-seat
license for the Content. You may make one (1) copy of the Content solely
for back-up purposes, and you must reproduce all proprietary notices on
this single back-up copy.

(c) Permitted Uses. Subject to the restrictions described under
Prohibited Uses below, the following are "Permitted Uses" of Content:

   1. advertising and promotional projects, including printed materials,
product packaging, presentations, film and video presentations,
commercials, catalogues, brochures, promotional greeting cards and
promotional postcards (ie. not for resale or license);
   2. entertainment applications, such as books and book covers,
magazines, newspapers, editorials, newsletters, and video, broadcast and
theatrical presentations;
   3. on–line or electronic publications, including web pages to a
maximum of 800 x 600 pixels, but excluding use in web-based or desktop
prototyping or page building tools and applications;
   4. prints, posters (i.e. a hardcopy) and other reproductions for
personal use or promotional purposes specified in (1) above, but not for
resale, license or other distribution; and
   5. any other uses approved in writing by Konigi.

If there is any doubt that a proposed use is a Permitted Use, you should
contact Konigi for guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Standard License Prohibitions
--------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Prohibited Uses. You may not do anything with the Content that is
not expressly permitted in the preceding section. For greater certainty,
the following are "Prohibited Uses" and you may not:

   1. use the Content in design template applications intended for
resale, whether on-line or not, including, without limitation, website
templates, Flash templates, business card templates, electronic greeting
card templates, and brochure design templates;
   2. use of the icons in commercial applications that offer the icons as 
part of a product or service for sale or for fee-based usage;
   3. use the Content in web-based or desktop prototyping and page building
applications that allow the Content to be repeatedly inserted into pages
or prototypes;
   4. use or display the Content on websites or other venues designed to
induce or involving the sale, license or other distribution of "on
demand" products or services, including postcards, mugs, t-shirts,
posters and other items (this includes custom designed websites, as well
as sites such as www.cafepress.com);
   5. use the Content in any posters (printed on paper, canvas or any
other media) or other items for resale, license or other distribution
for profit;
   6. use any of the Content as part of a trade-mark, design-mark,
trade-name, business name, service mark, or logo;
   7. incorporate the Content in any product that results in a
re-distribution or re-use of the Content (such as electronic greeting
card web sites, web templates and the like) or is otherwise made
available in a manner such that a person can extract or access or
reproduce the Content as an electronic file;
   8. sub-license, re-sell, rent, lend, assign, gift or otherwise

   9. install and use the Content in more than one location at a time or
post a copy of the Content on a network server or web server for use by
other users;
   10. use or display the Content in an electronic format that enables it
to be downloaded or distributed via mobile devices or shared in any
peer-to-peer or similar file sharing arrangement;
   11. use the Content for editorial purposes without including the
following credit adjacent to the Content: "Konigi.com"; or
   4. either individually or in combination with others, reproduce the

without obtaining a Rights Managed License Agreement, in which event you 
will be required to obtain a Rights Managed License with Konigi. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
4. Excess Reproduction Run
--------------------------------------------------------------

In the event you contravene subparagraph 3(a)(xii) above without
purchasing a Rights Managed License, you further agree to notify Konigi 
in the event that you (or a combination of you and others involved with
you) reproduce the Content, or an element of the Content in excess of
500,000 times. Such disclosure notice must be sent to Konigi in order
create terms of a Rights Managed Agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------
5. Term of Agreement
--------------------------------------------------------------

(a) This Agreement is effective until it is terminated. You can
terminate this Agreement by destroying the Content and any Permitted
Derivative Works, along with any copies or archives of it or
accompanying materials (if applicable), and ceasing to use the Content
for any purpose. The Agreement also terminates without notice from
Konigi if at any time you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon
termination, you must immediately (i) cease using the Content and for
any purpose; (ii) destroy or delete all copies and archives of the
Content or accompanying materials; and (iii) if requested, confirm to
Konigi in writing that you have complied with these requirements.

(b) Konigi reserves the right to elect at a later date to revoke or
amend the license granted by this Agreement and replace the Content with
an alternative for any reason. Upon notice, sent to the address or
contact information provided by you for your member account, or such
other address as you may advise us in writing to use, from time to time,
of such replacement, the license for the replaced Content immediately
terminates for any products that do not already exist, and this license
automatically applies to the replacement Content. You agree not to use
the replaced Content, or any Permitted Derivative Works, for future
products and to take all reasonable steps to discontinue use of the
replaced Content, or any Permitted Derivative Works, in products that
already exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------

INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHERWISE.

(c) IN ANY EVENT, THE TOTAL MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF KONIGI UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, THE LICENSE PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OR THE USE OR
EXPLOITATION OF ANY OR ALL OF THE CONTENT IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER SHALL
BE LIMITED TO THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO KONIGI UNDER THIS
