        I grew up making artâ€”some of my earliest childhood memories are of making paper toys and puzzle books. I'm currently working on illustration and mixed media pieces and am actively engaged in guerrilla neighborhood art installations in Northern California. My work oscillates between the minimal and distressed, which I think is a reflection of the influence of Corita Kent and Robert Rauschenberg. Moving to Marin County, California from Brooklyn, NY has also  shaped how I see the world. I sometimes work with symbols of nature and connectedness and other times find comfort making <em>digital mash up</em> pieces that express my discontent with politics and American popular culture.</p>
        <p>It's worth nothing that I also host a free little art gallery in Sausalito with my wife, called the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seaprinceflag/">Sea Prince FLAG</a>, where I offer up a lot of my small drawings and mixed media pieces to the community for free.</p>
