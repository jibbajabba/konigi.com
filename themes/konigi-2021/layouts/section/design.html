        <p>I worked in various roles prior as designer, information architect, and front end developer at companies including Sling Media, Sapient, Bell Labs, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. My CV is in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelangeles/">LinkedIn</a>. I was a co-founder of the Information Architecture Institute and published several blogs since 1998 including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020201165417/http://studioid.com/studio/">studio id</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040429043907/http://iaslash.org/">iaslash</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050401/http://urlgreyhot.com/personal/">urlgreyhot</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503064343/http://konigi.com/">former version</a> of this site. </p>

        <p>Below is a collection of design articles I wrote, presentations, and tools I made long ago. I've also published several articles in journals. More info on publications can be found in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6B-ttHcAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>. Several of my early website designs from the early 2000s have also been published in design books, which I've sadly discarded over the years.</p>

        <h2>Tools and DIY Resources</h2>
        <p>Prior to working at Balsamiq, the tool that I've shared that's been most used is a <a href="https://konigi.com/tools/omnigraffle-wireframe-stencils/">Wireframe Stencil made for OmniGraffle</a> as well as some templates and icons. The stencil ships with the product. I hear from people occasionally that they still also use the tools below.</p>

        <h2>Really Old Stuff...</h2>
        
        <p>My very old <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/tools/">design tools</a> including the Wireframe Stencils and Icons that I made for OmniGraffle, galleries of interesting <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/interfaces/">user interfaces</a> and <a href="/designs">website designs</a> (created by others) are archived and no longer updated.</p>
        <p>I also had a sort of wiki where I kept definitions of UX techniques and topics that I would link to whenever it seemed helpful to provide background to colleagues or in articles I wrote.
