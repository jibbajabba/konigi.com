Ping, ping, ping. Software should stay out of the way so I can get stuff done.

I have trouble focusing on certain types of work and need to turn notifications off and use alarms and timers to stay on task. I've written about my [constant pursuit of focus](/notebook/finding-focus-while-trying-work.html). To give you an idea of how obsessive I am about this, take a look at [what my desktop looks like](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jibbajabba/14895848441). The desktop wallpaper is by [Hector Simpson](http://dizzyup.co.uk/wallpapers).


These are some of the apps I use to put the blinders on. (Last updated December 21, 2023)

**[Nova](https://nova.app)**  
Panic's Nova is my code editor. I use it for all of my sites.


**[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com)**  
Quicksilver was my launcher for years. Alfred has replaced it. Minimal and there when I need it, and does much more than I expect it to.

**[Notes](https://support.apple.com/guide/notes/welcome/mac)**  
I was a power user of Evernote since its launch. But in an attempt to simplify and downsize my spending, I ported all of my notes to Apple Notes, which was a simpler task than I thought it'd be. Now I maintain my daily task list (using the Checklist feature) and write all of my notes in the Apple app, and they're all kept in sync via iCloud for access via desktop or iOS device.

**[Pomodoro](http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com)**    
This is an unobtrusive Pomodoro timer that sits in the menubar so you can set it when you start a task. The [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) uses 25 minute increments for focusing on tasks. 

**[Cascade, my Pomodoro soundtrack](https://soundcloud.com/konigimusic/cascade)**  
I created a 30 minute background music track for listening to while working and studying using the Pomodoro technique. It's 25 minutes of music with a 5 minute break. The music incorporates binaural beats and has breakdowns at approximately every 5 minute mark, signified by 3 notes of a bell, and small varied piano pieces. 

**[Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12)**  
I'm a single-application mode Mac user. I often use Cmd-Opt-Click to view apps in single app mode, so when I do, I like to position app windows front and center, or sometimes pinned to one side or expanded to full screen. Magnet lets me click Ctrl-Option-C to do this in a split second.

**[Default Folder](http://stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX)**  
When I save something, I usually want to quickly navigate to my most recent, most used, or favorite locations. This utility makes it a piece of cake.

**[Unclutter](http://unclutterapp.com)**  
It makes me happy to see nothing on my desktop. Unclutter tucks away my desktop files into a drawer that I can access with a 2-finger downward swipe gesture at the top of my screen. It can holds frequently accessed files, a multi-clip clipboard, and a scratchpad for notes.
