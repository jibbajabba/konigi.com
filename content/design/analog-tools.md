<h2>Sketching Pens and Markers</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Ultra-Point-LH-20C4/dp/B06Y3T81ZZ/">PIlot Hi-Tec-C 0.4mm (black)</a></strong><br />
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Ultra-Point-LH-20C4/dp/B06Y3T81ZZ/">This is the black gel pen</a> I carry in my pocket. Always with me, and unforgivingly hard and fine. It's my preferred tool for small thumbnail sketching in my pocket sketchbook and on my 8-up sheets, where I work in small areas on mostly abstract boxes and arrows. I like it for general sketching (non-work related) because the fine line makes me work light and loose in the beginning to capture an essence, but then work up details around that. On my desk, I have the Hi-Tec-C in CW&amp;T's <a href="http://shop.cwandt.com/products/pen-type-a">Pen Type A</a> aluminum housing. I'm also a fan of the <a href="https://www.muji.us/collections/pen-pencils/products/gel-ink-cap-type-ballpoint-pen-0-7mm-8a63">Muji 0.7mm Gel Pen</a>.</p>

These are an overlooked gem. I was a user of these for close to ten years when I lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn, until the stationery store that carried them around the block from me closed. They're soft and flow smoothly, like a 2b pencil. I love these because unlike Sharpies, they don't bleed through the thinner weight of sketchbook papers.</p>

This is the standby that almost everyone I know uses. It's great because the lines are broad and perfect for rough thinking. When I sketch with one, I imagine being something like a 3-5px tool or very fat 2-3b soft pencil.  They bleed through most normal notebook/sketchbook paper that's under 70#. I like that using it forces you to go forward and restart if you make mistakes rather than get fussy.</p>

<h2>Sketch Books</h2>
<p><strong><a href="/tools/sketchbooks-diy/">DIY Sketchbooks</a></strong><br />
I mostly <a href="https://konigi.com//tools/sketchbooks-diy/">make my own</a> because I like making a smaller book with my own paper, and with a ring cover that can fold over onto the back. I use these for most of my design sketches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Cahier-Cover-Journal-Pocket/dp/8883704908/">Moleskine Pocket Cahier Squared Notebook</a></strong><br />
I still use the squared notebook when I'm not using my own. Since they're available at stationers everywhere, and are the perfect size for desk and bag, it's an easy choice, and well made.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../tools/graph-paper.html">Loose Graph Papers</a></strong><br />
If you've been following along on this site, you know I love minimalist papers made for the job. The Wireframe and 8-up sheets are the hardest working of the graph papers I use when I'm at a desk.</p>
