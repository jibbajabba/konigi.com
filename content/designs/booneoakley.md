BooneOakley's new web site is actually a series of YouTube videos with links placed via annotations into the videos to connect all of what we might traditionally think of as sections. What they create is something like a network of hypertext connections to hold together a concept of site&#8212;hacked together boundaries that create space within another larger space. Using annotations to do that is pretty clever.</p>
<p>Some pretty harsh digs on large agencies, and a really funny jokes in there. Appropriate to the kind of witty work they do. I also like their use illustrations over the timeline to create another sense of navigation. The video production in their client reels are really enjoyable as well.</p>
