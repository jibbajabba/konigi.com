<p>Nice minimalist design from this London, UK creative organization that is equal parts industry publisher, awards host, events coordinator, and agency, serving up design and communication needs through the members of its collective. This is a multi-faceted org, and starting with the homepage and looking around through the pages, you get the impression that there's a lot of content on this site, and a lot of people involved. </p>
<p>The challenge upon arriving there for the first time is to understand what they're about. The title/tagline seems to convey enough maybe, but the about page reveals the most info. I always find it challenging as a designer to distill what something is about and find the right way to message that essence for different types of users.</p>
