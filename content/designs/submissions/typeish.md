<p>typeish is a showcase of images, joining sites such as ffffound and weheartit. The site notes that it differentiates itself by limiting the participants to a select group that will curate the gallery. Stylistically, the yellow legal pad with scribbles and coffee stains makes this site stand out from the bunch of galleries out there, which I generally categorize at either end of the spectrum as either minimalist with few graphics or textured, 3 dimensional or glossy on the other end. This is somewhere near the latter.</p>
