<p>I have a weakness for ultra clean, modern sites, especially those that are devoted to showcasing photos, screenshots, or video. The minimalist sites that minimize graphics, let type function directly as interface, and all but vanish from your awareness really let the content come to the fore. Among the video portals, blip.tv is the one that fits this description perfectly. </p>
