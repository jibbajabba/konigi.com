<p>Krolikov is the illustration and animation studio of Russian designer Sedova Elena. Great illustration, and the subtle 3d effect of the boxes adds dimension and interest to the frame surrounding the content. The little touches of animation are brilliant, e.g. the plug in effect on the home link electrical cord and the little motion when mousing over the global nav. I was sort of expecting the little character on top of the books to wink at me or something.</p>
