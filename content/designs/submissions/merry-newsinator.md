<p>So this year my company plaid decided to create a tool to help people save time around the holidays. It's called the Merry Newsinator and it generates a customized personal newsletter in about 3 minutes. Anyways hope you like it and would love to see you post it. I have included one we did for santa claus below! Happy Holidays!</p>
