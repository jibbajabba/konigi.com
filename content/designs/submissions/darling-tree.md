<p>Joanna Klima is a freelance designer and craftsperson. I love the decorative fluorishes behind the body, the textured backgrounds, and the overall tone of the copy. There's a very handmade feel to the site, which goes along with the idea of providing more personal service, and the aesthetic that Klima is known for.</p>
