<p>TNOP's site is as minimalist as they come. A form select lets users navigate sections, and viewing content requires horizontal scrolling. I'm not a fan of horizontal scrolling, especially if I have to use the scroll bar versus an in-page control, but it's bare bones and well executed so I like it.</p>
