<p>Daisy is an artist that does incredible things with balloons. The site presently shows some amazing dresses fabricated with the long balloons you'd usually only see in the form of little animals, but Daisy elevates the art to design amazing clothing that could be called haute couture. I could easily imagine these things being made out of a less ephemeral material and being worn, albeit a bit uncomfortably.</p>
<p>The portfolio is bold and simple, with full-screen sized, closely-framed photography. Fabulous.</p>
