<p>TypeNeue is a typography blog that uses Suprb's <a href="http://suprb.com/grid-a-licious/">Grid A Liciouis</a> theme for WordPress to give it that dense multi-column layout. Entries are ordered reverse chronologically, but unlike typical columnar layouts, the entries are read from left to right first, then top to bottom, so the lines of demarcation are staggered. This creates a unexpectedness and less ordered feeling to the layout, but gives the design the ability to put more content into the screen above the fold.</p>
