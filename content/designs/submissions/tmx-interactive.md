<p>This clever, comical page for interactive agency, TMX Interactive, features video of a team led by some <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/61238/saturday-night-live-macgruber-w-macguyver#s-p1-st-i0">McGruber-like  dude</a> defusing a bomb while a clock ticks down to zero. The <a href="http://tmx2.tmxinteractive.com/index.asp">old site</a> with info about the company, including their portfolio is actually a lovely minimal site as well. </p>
