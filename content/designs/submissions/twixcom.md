<p>Man, the candy advertising biz sure spends a lot on creative work. While not as unexpected as the Skittles site, the interactive storytelling on Twix.com takes you through a scenario where you get to play a guy trying and lying to pick up a girl at a party by helping him make strategic decisions at each Twix moment. Guess 18-30-ish guys are their target demographic.  Clever use of interactive video and a humorous story to keep you engaged on the site for more than a few seconds.</p>
