<p>Westerdals is a communication design school in Norway for film, tv, and graphic design. The site's home page presents a mosaic of videos of teachers, previous teachers and current students who talk about what makes the school unique. Each of the rectangles in the grid is either a video or text block, which expands into adjacent squares on the grid when clicked in order to load a video player or text.</p>
<p>I always like monologue type videos or testimonials. The personal commentary is a nice, and provides a sincere touch for recruiting students. The format of this single page delivers the message very effectively from each of the different personas that represent the school.</p>
