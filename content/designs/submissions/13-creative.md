<p>I like the trompe l'oeil look of this paper product designer's portfolio, designed by Deluge Studios. It's like sneaking in and taking a snapshot of the sumptuous printed goodies on her desk while she's not looking. The multi-column text blocks on the notepad are nice (click the About page to see that), the colors are rich and elegant, and the decorative flourishes are lovely.</p>
