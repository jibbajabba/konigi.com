<p>Flash sites with minimalist layouts and huge navigation links are all the rage. But that's cool, because I rarely see one that I don't like. The colorful cool orbs bubbling in the background give me a warm fuzzy feeling--it's like having a clear lava lamp lightbox to drop photos onto. Love it.</p>
