<p>This is a bad-ass looking weblog with a very cool header. Big type and ample white space sets up a very clear visual hierarchy and makes it easy to read, and a strong center alignment of header/footer elements directs the eye. I love the big illustrated robot head in the header (kind of expecting it to wink at me) and the character photos in the footer. I also like the way the global navigation shifts so that the center link is whatever section you're viewing, which makes that centered look and directs your eyes downwards.</p>
