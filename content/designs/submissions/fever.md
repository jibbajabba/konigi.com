<p>Fever is a feed reading server product. The product site features a single-page design, with well-organized and clear product information at the top, and navigation anchors that scroll the page down. All of the features you need from the service&#8212;purchasing info, account info, customer support&#8212;are included dynamically in the single page, so once you've purchased the product, for instance, your customer info is populated into the account area. Support forms are also in-page. Simple and clever.</p>
