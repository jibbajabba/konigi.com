<p>Sick City Club are a new band hotly tipped for 2009 by UK's Radio One. The new site was designed and built by Zaum &amp; Brown. It's a full flash build powered by an xml cms. The design was inspired by traveling around a city, always being on the go. The sites most prominent feature is the bands new video playing as the background.</p>
