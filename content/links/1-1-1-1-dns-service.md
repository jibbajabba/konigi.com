<a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1</a> is a DNS service created by Cloudflare and APNIC to offer you a more private experience on the Internet. Here’s what they say:</p>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.

We will never log your IP address (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained KPMG to audit our systems annually to ensure that we’re doing what we say.</blockquote>
