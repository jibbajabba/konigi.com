[Stonly](https://stonly.com/) lets you create step-by-step explanations for various use cases such as onboarding, contextual in-product help, tutorials, and sales support. The product allows you to define a guide that can walk users through a series of steps to explain how to use a product feature, for example.

Stonly widgets can be embedded in your web pages and integration options exist for various CMS and CRM. It supports multi-choice conditions, the display of code and media, and language localization. You can also install a widget to appear in your page or application, like the floating feedback widgets we've become accustomed to seeing in the lower right corner of web sites.
