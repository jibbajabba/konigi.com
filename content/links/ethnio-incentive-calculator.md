Ethnio's <a href="https://ethn.io/incentives/calculator">UX Research Incentive Calculator</a> provides a way to estimate how much to pay research participants in different parts of the world, based on the type of study, time to complete and geographic location. Note that if you provide a prize or giveaway, this calculator won't help.
