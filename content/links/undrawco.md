<a href="https://undraw.co/">unDraw.co</a> provides open-source SVG images that you can use free and without attribution. The types of images provided look like they might be useful for landing pages and presentation. An accent color picker allows you to set the accent color for illustrations and updates all of the images to use it; useful for customizing to your brand's primary color. The project was created by Katerina Limpitsouni.
