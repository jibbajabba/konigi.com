    <h3>This is a blog in search of a purpose.</h3>
    <br/>

    <p>In life I’m exploring the question, “what matters now?” and this blog will jibe with each change in the journey.</p>

    <p>I’ve been starting with a manifesto for myself, based on exploring what matters to me. On a trail run in June these words came to me. I’m considering them my manifesto for the moment.</p>

    <blockquote class="is-size-4">
      I move because if I’m standing still, I’m dying.<br/><br/>
      I create, as my soul knows no better way to be free.<br/><br/>
      I love like it’s the only thing that matters.<br/>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is a pretty good description of the actions and people at the top of the list of what matters to me.  It's simple enough for me to follow. I move. I make. I love. I think in bullet points when I run, I guess.</p>

    <p>There are other things I need to work on. Forgiveness, non-attachment, being more open. I could go into the deeper list of things I value and could focus on, but for the moment, I'm working on prioritizing life around the things in this list. </p>

    <p>For the moment...</p>

    <h4>Nice things people have said about Konigi...</h4>

    <hr/>

    <p>Konigi is a *fantastic* resource for every User Interface Designer.<br />
    &#8212;<a href="http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2008/02/konigi.html">swissmiss</a></p>

    <p>It’s perfect for those times when you’re designing a feature and you want to review all the prior art. It’s worth keeping an eye on.<br />

    <p>One source I love for examples of successful interface and visual design is konigi.com. Rather than focusing on an entire site or application, they just highlight out individual nuggets of gold.<br />

    <p>Konigi is a beautiful site chock full of inspiration for user experience designers.<br />

    <p>I think its a brilliant Idea. I am pretty sure the big game changer designs will be inspired from R&amp;D on this website.<br />
