<p>This is a blog in search of a purpose.</p>

<p>In life I’m exploring the question, “what matters now?” and this blog will jibe with each change in the journey.</p>

<p>I’ve been starting with a manifesto for myself, based on exploring what matters to me. On a trail run these words came to me. I’m considering them my manifesto for the moment.</p>

<blockquote class="is-size-4">
  I move because if I’m standing still, I’m dying.<br/><br/>
  I create, as my soul knows no better way to be free.<br/><br/>
  I love like it’s the only thing that matters.<br/>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty good description of the actions and people at the top of the list of what matters to me. It's simple enough for me to follow. I move. I make. I love. I think in bullet points when I run, I guess.</p>

<p>There are other things I need to work on. Forgiveness, non-attachment, being more open. I could go into the deeper list of things I value and could focus on, but for the moment, I'm working on prioritizing life around the things in this list. </p>
