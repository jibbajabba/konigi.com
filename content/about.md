<p>Hi, from Michael! I'm a dad, husband, artist, dj and designer living in Northern California. </p>
<p>I've been an interface designer since 1998, at Balsamiq since 2012. I've published articles and spoken at conferences on the topic of wireframing for product design and  co-authored the book <em><a href="https://abookapart.com/products/wireframing-for-everyone">Wireframing for Everyone</a></em>. I created the IA Slash and Konigi blogs on interface design, and served as advisor and cofounder of the Information Architecture Institute.  You can find out more about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelangeles/">my design career on LinkedIn</a>. My personal life has been largely chronicled on <a href="https://instagram.com/konigi">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>I can best be reached using <a href="https://forms.gle/4yw6x6zDU7VESws29" target="_blank">my contact form</a>. You can also contact me via Instagram by DM using <a href="https://www.instagram.com/konigi/">@konigi</a>.</p>
